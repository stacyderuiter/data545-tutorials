## Preface: What's a Model?

We will spend most of this course learning to fit different kinds of
*regression models*. What are they?

We will learn as we go. But as a starting point...

-   In a regression model, we have one main **response** or **outcome**
    variable of interest
-   We want to assess whether our response variable is or isn't
    associated with (some of) a suite of possible **predictor**
    variables (also sometimes known as *covariates* but we'll avoid the
    word "covariates" because it sometimes means slightly different
    things in different disciplines).

Essentially, we are looking to quantify relationships between our
response and predictor(s) -- accompanied by appropriate measures of the
uncertainty of our estimates.

## Section Learning Outcomes

This section, we will learn strategies for planning a regression model -
how many variables, and which ones, should be included as predictors?
How does an analyst decide? What principles underlie these decisions?

By the end of the section you will:

1)  Define a causal diagram, and the variable types that can be depicted
    in one
2)  Use a causal diagram to determine which variables to include as
    predictors in a regression model
3)  Apply the n/15 rule-of-thumb in model planning, to determine how
    many coefficients can be reliably estimated with a given dataset
4)  Combine a causal diagram, the n/15 rule, and a modeling goal to
    articulate a well-reasoned plan for a multiple linear regression
    model

Along the way, we will also review some introductory stat material on
study design and types of experiments, to make sure we are all have the
same vocabulary in place. You won't be directly assessed on this
material and so it is marked as optional.
