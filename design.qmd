# Sample and Study Design 

Before you can start modeling, you need data.

In our course, we focus on analyzing data (not collecting it), and we use datasets that have already been collected by others.

But to do analysis well, you need to consider the *metadata* -- for example, who collected your data, and why? How was it obtained exactly? To know how these things might influence our analysis and conclusions, we might need a quick review of sampling strategies and study design.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(webexercises)
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=16))

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  fig.align = "center",
  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2.5)
```


## Sampling Strategies 

Almost every dataset contains information on a *sample* of cases from a
larger *population*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pop-sample-param-stat.png')
```

And if the sample is biased -- that is, not representative of the full
population in important ways -- then we won't be able to make any valid
inferences from it. So the process used to choose a sample is crucial to
the validity of all results! What are ways to choose a sample?

## Sampling Infographic 

Here's an infographic version of the main ideas here, in infographic
form. This infographic includes a couple additional sampling approaches
that are used in human health studies, and also introduces one more bit
of terminology: *probability* vs. *non-probability* sampling. In
probability methods, there is some element of random selection that is
used; in non-probability samping, there is not.

*You can also [view the infographic on the
web](https://www.slideshare.net/Intellspot/types-of-sampling-methods-infographic).*

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/sampling-schemes-infographic.png')
```

## Study Design 

A crucial distinction is between two broad classes of research studies:
*observational* studies and *experimental* studies.

*Side note: many students in the sciences find that the statistical
definition of an "experimental study" doesn't mesh perfectly with the
definition of an "experiment" that they learn in science courses. If it
helps, you can think of "experiment" keeping the colloquial meaning it
has in your field, and think of "experimental study" as a technical
statistical descriptor of a study (as we will learn it today).*

You probably have prior knowledge or a good intuitive guess as to the
difference between studies that are observational and experimental.
We'll review key concepts more later on, but to start, take a chance to
assess your existing hunches. Study the infographic below with this
distinction in mind: **Does the infographic confirm, modify, or add
nuance to your initial idea of how "observational" and "experimental"
studies differ?** As a bonus, the image also details a few kinds of
studies within each broad class, and orders them in terms of the
strength of evidence they can provide.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://i0.wp.com/www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Rough-Guide-to-Types-of-Scientific-Evidence.png?ssl=1')
```

### An Alternative

You may spend less time with this one - but here's [an alternative
infographic](https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/about-nih/public-trust/clinical-trials-infographic.pdf)
covering much of the same information. It's organized differently, but
consistent - dive in if you'd like to review again!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/study-types-infographic.png')
```

One thing to notice in this version is the emphasis on **randomized
experimental studies** like clinical trials as a source of possible
**causal conclusions** -- the NIH notes that a randomized experiment has
the best chance of allowing researchers to conclude that one thing
*causes* another, while that is difficult to impossible in observational
work. Why?

### Why Randomization?

*Randomization* is a key tactic for ensuring the results of an
experimental study are reliable, and providing a strong basis for
concluding that a particular treatment or intervention *causes* a
certain outcome or result.

Randomization means participants are *assigned randomly* to different
"treatments;" they are randomly chosen to receive different assigned
values of the key variable(s) that researchers are controlling or
manipulating. If this procedure is not followed, then the different
treatment groups may differ systematically in some important feature
(like gender, motivation, initial health status - anything that might
influence the outcome). Here's one more video that explains the issue
quite clearly, in the context of human randomized controlled trials:

### Random SAMPLE vs RANDOMIZATION

Careful! Many students confuse random sampling with randomization, or
use one term when they mean the other. Check your understanding: which
is which?

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
```{r results = 'asis'}
#| label: randomization-def

opts <- sample(c(answer = "Random sampling has to do with how cases to study are randomly chosen from the population, while randomization has to do with how already-chosen participants are randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups.",
        "It depends on the context; they are very similar",
        "Randomization has to do with how cases to study are randomly chosen from the population, while random sampling has to do with how already-chosen participants are randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups."))

cat("What is the difference between random sampling and randomization?",
    longmcq(opts))
```
:::

`r hide("Click for explanations of solution above.")`

The words seem similar, but are distinct technical terms!

*Randomization* has to do with how values of a "treatment" variable of
special interest are assigned: randomly!

*Random sampling* means that the individuals (whether they are people,
places, or things...) in the study were selected from the population at
random.

`r unhide()`

## Observational vs Experimental Studies 

We mentioned earlier that the key distinction for us will be between
observational and experimental studies. Hopefully you've already started
to form a mental map of the differences. Here's one of the most clear,
concise, complete statements of the main ideas I've ever heard:

And now, a one-minute review of the basics:

*You can also [watch outside this

By now, you should be able to provide a short definition of each study
type and note key differences between *observational* and *experimental*
studies.
