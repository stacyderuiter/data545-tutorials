    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nOne way to access R and RStudio is via an account at https://r.stem.calvin.edu/ (or if not a Calvin student, at posit.cloud). To use RStudio on one of these servers, all you need to do is log in, with nothing to install or maintain.\nFor many, this cloud approach is a great way to use RStudio, and they have no reason to install a standalone copy of the software on a personal computer. If you are happy using the server, exit this tutorial now and continue happily using the server!\nIf you have concerns about your internet bandwidth, speed, usage limits, or firewalls, or if you want to be able to work on assignments for this class somewhere without internet access, or if you need to analyze really large datasets or fit complex models, you may want to install R and RStudio and work locally instead of on the server.",

(If you don’t know what this means yet, you will soon - and you do probably need to be able to do it.)\nThis one has two steps: installing the package, and then using the package to install the PDF-generation utility.\nIf you already have TeX/LaTeX/MikTeX installed on your computer, you can probably skip this installation (but it won’t hurt).\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX\n\n\n\nPoint-and-Click Option\nIf you would like to install the packages interactively instead of on the command line (as already shown above), you can click the Packages tab on the lower right in RStudio, then click Install at the top of the tab. Enter the names of the packages you want to install in the middle “Packages” blank, and leave the rest of the default options, then click “Install”.",

    "section": "2.2 Communicating with R",
    "text": "2.2 Communicating with R\nYou will do most of your work in R with code or commands. Instead of pointing and clicking, you will type one or more lines of code, which R will execute (doing the work you have asked it to do).\nThen, R will return the results of whatever operation you asked it to do - sometimes producing a plot, other times creating a plot.\nSometimes executing code has almost no visible effect (no plot or text output is produced), but instead some object is created and stored in R’s environment for later use.\n\nTwo Key Questions\nTo get R (or any software) to do something for you, there are two important questions you must be able to answer. Before continuing, think about what those questions might be.\n\n\nThe Questions\nTo get R (or any software) to do a job for you, there are two important questions you must be able to answer:\n\n1. What do you want the computer to do?\n\n\n2. What must the computer know in order to do that?\n\n\n\nProviding R with the information it needs\nR functions provide R with the answer to the first question: what do you want the computer to do?\nMost functions in R have short, but descriptive names that describe what they do. For example, R has some functions to do basic mathematical operations: the function sqrt() computes the square root of a number, and the function round() rounds a number (by default, it rounds to the nearest integer).\nBut just giving R a function is not enough: you also need to answer the second question (what information does R need to do the job?). For example, if you want to use the function round(), you also need to provide R with the number you want to round!\nWe will provide answers to our two questions by filling in the boxes of a basic template:\n\n\nfunction (  information1  ,  information2  , …)\n\n\n \n(The ... indicates that there may be some additional input arguments (input information we could provide to R) we could add eventually. Some functions need only one input, but if a function takes more than one argument, they are separated by commas. They have names, and if named (like: function(input_name = value, input2_name = 'value')) they can be in any order.\n\n\nUsing simple functions\nLet’s practice what you just learned, trying out the mathematical sqrt() and round() functions.\nEdit the code below to compute the square root of 64:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using the sqrt() function:\nsqrt(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input information that sqrt() needs to make your calculation is the number you want the square root of: 64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nsqrt(64)\n\n\n\n\nNow try computing the square root of 44, and then rounding it to the nearest integer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to use two functions this time:\nThe sqrt() function, and then the round() function.\nsqrt(___)\nround(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input information that sqrt() needs to make your calculation is the number you want the square root of: 44. Run that code first, to get the input you will need for round()…\nsqrt(44)\nround(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nsqrt(44)\nround(6.63325)\nCan you do it all in one go? Well…yes!\nround(sqrt(44))\nThere’s also an easier-to-read way to do that, using a pipe operator |&gt;. It takes the output of one operation and passes it as input to the next. You can read it as |&gt; = “and then…” so we could do:\nsqrt(44) |&gt;\n  round()\n\nTake the square root of 44, and then\nround the result.\n\n(More on pipes later!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring information in R: variables\nIn the last section, you computed the square root of 44 and then rounded it, perhaps like this:\n\nsqrt(44)\n\n[1] 6.63325\n\nround(6.63325)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nBut to do that, you probably had to first find the root, make a note of the result, and then provide that number to the round function. What a pain!\nA very useful option, if you have value (or a variable, dataset, or other R object) that you will want to use later on, is to store it as a named object in R. In the previous example, you might want to store the square root of 44 in a variable called my_root; then you can provide my_root to the round() function without checking the result of the sqrt() calculation first:\n\nmy_root &lt;- sqrt(44)\nround(my_root)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nNotice that to assign a name to the results of some R code, you use the symbol &lt;-. You can think of it as an assignment arrow – it points from a value or item toward a name and assigns the name to the thing.\nTry editing the code to change the name of the variable from my_root to something else, then run your new code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you change the name my_root in both places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_new_name &lt;- sqrt(44)\nround(your_new_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a list of numbers to store?\nSometime you might want to create a variable that contains more than one number. You can use the function c() to concatenate a list of numbers:\n\nmy_fave_numbers &lt;- c(4, 44, 16)\nmy_fave_numbers\n\n[1]  4 44 16\n\n\n(First we stored the list of numbers, calling it my_fave_numbers; then we printed the results to the screen by simply typing the variable name my_fave_numbers).\nTry making a list of your three favorite numbers, then using the function sum to add them all up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst use c() to concatenate your chosen numbers (separated by commas).\nDon’t forget to use &lt;- to assign your list of numbers a name!\nThen, use sum() to add them up.\nmy_numbers &lt;- c(___,___,___)\nsum(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one possible solution.\nmy_numbers &lt;- c(4, 16, 44)\nsum(my_numbers)\nNotice you could also nest sum() and c(), or use the pipe operator |&gt; to calculate the numeric answer, but then you would not have the object my_numbers available for later use…\nsum(c(4, 16, 44))\n# or \nc(4, 16, 44) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about data that are not numeric?\nR can work with categorical data as well as numeric data. For example, we could create a list of words and store it as a variable if we wanted (feel free to try changing the words if you want):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a LOT more data to store?\nc() works great for creating small lists of just a few values, but it is not a good way to enter or store large data tables - there is lots of potential for user error. In this course, you will usually be given a dataset already in electronic form; if you need to create one, you would turn to spreadsheet or database software. Either way you read the existing data file into R directly.\nIn R, these larger datasets are stored as objects called data.frames. The next sections will get you started using them.",

    "text": "2.4 Using built-in datasets in R\nR has a number of built-in datasets that are accessible to you as soon as you start RStudio.\nIn addition to the datasets that are included with base R, there are add-on packages for R that contain additional software tools and sometimes datasets.\nTo use datasets contained in a package, you have to load the package by running the command:\n\nlibrary(packagename) \n\n\nExample of loading a package\nFor example, we will practice looking at a dataset from the package mosaic.\nBefore we can access the data, we have to load the package. The code might look like this:\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n(Nothing obvious will happen when you run this code…it basically just gives R permission to access the package, so there is often no output visible.)\n\n\nViewing a dataset\nThe mosaic package includes a dataset called HELPrct.\nIf you just run the dataset name (HELPrct) as a command, R will print some (or all - egad!) of the dataset out to the screen! (So don’t…)\nBut…how can we extract selected, useful information about a dataset?\n\n\nGathering information about a dataset\nThere are a few functions that make it easier to take a quick look at a dataset:\n\nhead() prints out the first few rows of the dataset.\nnames() prints out the names of the variables (columns) in the dataset\ndplyr::glimpse() (function glimpse() from package dplyr) gives an short list-like overview of the dataset\nskimr::skim() (function skim() from the package skimr) prints out more detailed graphical summary information about a dataset\nnrow() reports the number of rows (observations or cases) in the dataset\nncol() reports the number of columns (variables) in the dataset\n\nTry applying each of these functions to the HELPrct data and see what the output looks like each time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for each of the functions is the name of the dataset: HELPrct.\nhead(HELPrct)\nnames(HELPrct)\nnrow(HELPrct)\nncol(HELPrct)\nskimr::skim(HELPrct)\ndplyr::glimpse(HELPrct)\nIn this case, the point is usually to view the information on-screen, not to store it for later use, so we have not used &lt;- at all to store any output for later use or reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting more help\nYou can get help related to R function, and built-in R datasets, using a special function: ?.

    "section": "2.5 Reading in data from a file",
    "text": "2.5 Reading in data from a file\nFor this class, you will often be asked to analyze data that is stored in files that are available online - usually in csv format. It’s simple to read them into R. For example, we can read in the file MI_lead.csv, which is stored at https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv using the function read_csv() (from package readr or super-package tidyverse):\n\nlibrary(readr) # the readr package contains the read_csv() function\nMI_lead &lt;- read_csv(file = 'https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv')\n\n\nThe most common mistakes\nThe code below contains several of the most common mistakes students make when they try to read in a data file. See if you can find and correct them all!\nThe code below - if corrected - would (on posit.cloud or in standalone R/RStudio) run without an error and read in some baseball statistics from the file http://stacyderuiter.github.io/teachingdata/data-raw/baseball.csv.\nHere in this tutorial, it may give the error: ! curl package not installed, falling back to using url() – there’s not a straightforward fix, sorry, but try it on the server if you want to prove to yourself that it works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nIs the filename or URL spelled correctly, with no typos?\nIs the filename or URL in quotation marks (either ” or ’ work equally)?\nIs the URL complete (including the file extension “.csv”)\nWas &lt;- used to assign a name to the dataset once read in? (Otherwise it will just be uselessly printed to the screen and not available for later use!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nbaseball_data &lt;- read_csv(file = 'http://stacyderuiter.github.io/teachingdata/data-raw/baseball.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about local files?\nThe same function, read_csv(), can be used to read in a local file. You just need to change the input to read_csv() – instead of a URL, you provide a path and filename (in quotes). For example, the input file = 'https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv' might become file = 'C:\\\\Data\\\\MI_lead.csv'.\nWe won’t do an example in this tutorial because it’s not straightforward to work with local files within a tutorial environment, but you can practice it once you are working independently in RStudio.\nIf you are working on the server r.cs.calvin.edu, you will have to upload files to your cloud space on the server before you can read them in (RStudio on the server cannot access files on your computer’s hard drive). Look in the “Files” tab on the lower right, and then click “Upload.”\n\n\nNamed input arguments\nThe input argument we provided to R is the URL (in quotes – either single or double quotes are fine). But notice that this time, we gave the input argument a name, “file”, and specified its value with an equal sign.\nThis is not required - the command works fine without it:\n\nMI_lead &lt;- read_csv('https://sldr.netlify.app/data/MI_lead.csv')\n\nHowever, if a function has more than just one input argument, it’s good to get in the habit of providing names for the inputs. If you provide names, then the order in which you list the inputs doesn’t matter; without names, the order matters and you have to use ? to figure out what order R expects!\n\n\nRenaming variables in a dataset\nThis is an advanced topic, so don’t worry if it seems complicated; for now, it just nice to realize some of the power R has to clean up and reorganize data.\nWhat if we didn’t like the names of the MI_lead variables? For example, a new user of the dataset might not know that that ELL stands for “elevated lead levels” and that ELL2005 gives the proportion of tested kids who had elevated lead levels in the year 2005.\nIf we wanted to use a clearer (though longer) variable name, we might prefer “prop_elevated_lead_2005” instead of “ELL2005” – more letters to type, but a bit easier to understand for a new user. How can we tell R we want to rename a variable?\nWe use the code:\n\nMI_lead &lt;- MI_lead |&gt;\n  rename(prop_elevated_lead_2005 = ELL2005)\n\nglimpse(MI_lead)\n\nThe code above uses some tools you’ve seen, and some more advanced ones you haven’t seen yet. The symbol |&gt; is called a “pipe” and basically means “and then…” Translated into words, the code above tells R:\n\nMake a dataset called MI_lead by starting with the dataset MI_lead.\nNext, take the results do something more with them (|&gt;) …\nrename() a variable. What I want to rename is the variable ELL2005. Its new name should be prop_elevated_lead_2005.”\n\nSee…you can already start to make sense of even some pretty complicated (and useful) code.\nNote: If you give R several commands, not connected by pipes, it will do the first, then the second, then the third, and so on. R doesn’t need the pipe for permission to continue! Instead, the pipe tells R to take the results from the first command, and use them as the input or starting material for the next command.\n\n\nCheck out the data\nOK, back to business - simple functions and datasets in R.\nIt’s your turn to practice now. Use one of the functions you have learned so far to extract some information about the MI_lead dataset.\nHow many rows are in the dataset? How many variables (columns)?\nWhat are the variables named, and what are their values like?\nRemember, ? won’t work on MI_lead because it’s not a built-in R dataset. Also, the dataset MI_lead is already read in for you, here…so you don’t need to use read_csv().",

    "text": "3.5 Quarto (qmd) Files\n\nQuarto files are stand-alone!\nEvery Quarto file (qmd file) must be completely stand-alone. It doesn’t share any information with the Console or the Environment that you see in your RStudio session. All R code that you need to do whatever you are trying to do must be included in the qmd file itself!\nFor example, if you use the point-and-click user interface in the RStudio Environment tab to import a data file, that dataset will not be available when rendering your qmd file.\nSimilarly, if you load the mosaic package by typing in the Console window,\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nmosaic functions and data will not be available to use within the qmd file.\n\n\nSo: Keep your qmd files stand-alone! (You have no choice, actually…)\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Quarto file\nIn RStudio, navigate to File -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto Document…, or click on the white rectangle with a green circle+ :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand select Quarto from the drop-down menu.\nChoose html or pdf output.\n(Why not Word? Too much temptation to make changes and do formatting after the fact in Word…which makes your work no-longer-reproducible. In qmd, you have documented everything you’ve done. If you make changes after rendering to Word, that’s not true anymore.)\n\n\nSave your qmd file\nSave your file by clicking on the disk icon at the top of the file tab (give it a clear file name like deruiter_quarto_practice.qmd).\nDo your best to avoid spaces and special characters in your file names.\nIf on a server, the file will be saved to the cloud, not to your computer.\nAll your files will be accessible in the RStudio Files tab (lower right panel) whenever you log into RStudio, regardless of which computer you are using. You may organize them into directories (folders) if you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender!\nHow do qmd files actually work? What’s so cool about them?\nClick on the fat blue arrow next to the word “Render” at the top of the file window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the rendered html or pdf result, and compare it to the original Quarto file.\nWow!\n\n\nSource vs. Visual Editor\nLook to the upper right corner of your qmd file. You should see some buttons that allow you to toggle between “Source” and “Visual” editor modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your own file, toggle back and forth a few times. The Source mode lets you see (and type) the straight-up markdown – which is probably nice if you’re already used to it, and annoying or mystifying if not. The Visual mode is more of a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (like the rendered version), point-and-click type interface. You may use whichever you prefer.\nBe aware that if you are going to copy/paste between documents, you probably want to do so in Source mode.\n\n\nPersonalize your Markdown file\nAt the top of the Quarto file, there is a section called the “YAML header”. It starts and ends with 3 dashes - - -.\n\n\nIn this part of the file, be very careful what you type: a stray space or character will lead to an error.\n\n\nThis is where you can enter an appropriate title, author(s), and date (within the quotation marks). You can also choose the format you want to render to (usually pdf or html – not in quotes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize your YAML header in your own Quarto doc, and then render again to see the effect.\nMake sure you do this for every assignment!

You can also try format: typst to render PDF files a bit faster (learn more about typst output format online).\nBut if you choose html, there’s an important change you have to make to the YAML header to ensure your html file is stand-alone. Meaning: you want all images, etc. to be embedded in the one file rather than stored in an accompanying folder. Otherwise, when you (say) upload the file on Moodle or email it, all the images and graphs will be omitted…yikes! Yes, embedding these makes the file larger, but if you are sharing the rendered html document, you need to.\nIf rendering to html, it is essential that you specify the setting embed-resources: true!\nSo, make sure you add embed-resources: true after the entry format: html: in your YAML header, exactly as shown below.\nMake sure to keep the spacing and line breaks just as shown.\nThe indents are each two spaces, so there are 2 spaces before html: and 4 before embed-resources:.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode tools\nNote that the YAML header shown above also had a second option activated for rendered html files: code-tools: true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this one do?\nIt adds a button “Code” at the top right of your file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click it, you can view and copy the source code (basically, the contents of the original qmd file before rendering).

    "text": "3.7 Text and Code in Quarto\n\nText\nThe Quarto file is where you save all the R commands you want to use, plus any text commenting on the work you are doing and the results you get. Parts of the file with a plain white background are normal text.\nYou can format the text. For example, enclosing a word in asterisks will generate italics, so *my text* in the qmd file will become my text in the PDF. Using two asterisks instead of one will generate boldface, so **my text** becomes my text. You can also make bulleted lists, numbered lists, section headers, and more. For example,\n#### Some Text\nbecomes\n\nSome Text\n(a sub-section header). Fewer hashtags make the text even larger, and more make it smaller.\nCaution! Forgetting the space after the last hashtag will format your text verbatim rather than as a header (#fail). Failing to leave a blank line before the header can also make formatting fail.\nCheck out the Quarto Markdown Basics reference at https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html for more examples of how to format text in Quarto.\nBefore moving on, try a few of the tricks you just learned in your qmd file. Make it pretty!\n\n\n\nqmd file anatomy: R code chunks\nAn qmd file can (of course!) contain one or more R code chunks. These sections of the file have a grey background onscreen. In Source mode, each one begins with\n```{r}\nand ends with\n```\nlike so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Visual mode you can’t see the `:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to add a new R code chunk to your file\nTo add a code chunk to your file in Source editor mode, you have three options.\n\nYou can type in the header and footer by hand to start and end the chunk.\nYou can click on the “add chunk” button at the top right. It’s a green box with the C inside (at the top of the qmd file; choose the first option, “R”, in the pulldown) to insert an empty chunk.\nYou can use a keyboard shortcut: Windows, Ctrl + Alt + I or OS X, Cmd + Option + I\n\nWhen you click the Render button, code in code chunks will be run, and any output will be included in the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Chunk\nConsider using the first R code chunk in a qmd file to specify settings (for graphics, display, etc.). In this chunk, you can also give R permission to use certain packages (software toolkits) with\n\nlibrary(packagename) \n\nFor example, we will use the ggformula package for graphics. So, verify that the first R code chunk in your file includes the line library(ggformula).\nYou can also specify options for each R code chunk - these go at the top, prefaced by #|. A typical setup chunk for our course might look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that several packages are loaded (that we will use frequently). theme_set() is used to specify some settings for graph output, and knitr::opts_chunk$set() is used to specify whether or not to include R code in the rendered file (Yes please: use echo: true!) and specify the default figure size.\nThere are tons more options and settings, and you can explore them at https://yihui.org/renderr/options/#chunk-options.\nBut for now, if you use something like the setup chunk shown above, it should work well and have what you need for almost all work in this course.\n\n\nThe settings chunk is invisible!\nIf you look carefully at the rendered output, you will see that the setup chunk does not appear there. That’s intentional - when you load packages with library(), they often print a lot of long and pretty useless messages, which you want to omit from your rendered document.\nThis is achieved by having the setting include: false\nHowever, for our course, no chunk other than the setup chunk should have the setting “include: false” (or echo: false for that matter). Generally, anyone evaluating your coursework needs to see all the code you used, not just its output.\n\n\nClean Up\nAt this point, you probably want to get rid of all the extra content in the template.\nIf you haven’t put a setup chunk into your own qmd file…do it now! Here’s another reminder of how it would look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, Delete everything in the file other than the YAML header and your setup R code chunk.\nNow the clutter is gone and you have space to include your own R code and text.\n(Before going further, make sure it still renders.)",

In journalism and some parts of business, they are used very often. In the peer-reviewed scientific literature, they are exceedingly rare. In a slide deck, they are often useful…unless they say the same thing as your slide title! Know your goals and your audience.\n\nAvoid Redundant Titles\nIf you do want to use a title, make sure it provides information or details that are not already present in other text elements. A title that restates the axis labels is usually a waste:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we can argue about this a little. Could we have the title instead of the axis labels? Maybe, but if it’s a scientific publication, having the units of measure is going to be important.\nIs this title actually adding info because it clarifies that “Town,” “City,” etc. are “Locations”? I think it’s a stretch, but sometimes you can make such a case.\nGenerally, my advice is…\n\n\nIf the title is not adding something new and crucial and helping the reader decipher the main story of the plot, then omit it!\n\n\nSo what might an “informative” title look like?",

    "text": "Background\n\nWhat’s a “graph”?\nA note about vocabulary: in this course, when we say “visualization” or “graph” or “plot” we mean a picture displaying data.\nSpreadsheets and tables presenting data are not included - If you are asked to “produce a graph” or “create a visualization” a table of summary statistics is not generally a desirable response.\nTables are not unimportant; they just don’t count, to us, as graphs, plots, or visualizations.\nOften a table might accompany a visualization, for additional reference and numeric values to cite…but we’d argue that it’s usually the picture that is memorable, and that tells the story.\n\n\nLibraries\nThere are many ways to generate graphics in R. Some popular packages for visualization in R include graphics (which is included in the most basic R installation) and ggplot2. If you don’t know any of those yet, don’t worry a bit (and maybe continue right to the next section). If you do know one of those other systems, read on…\nIn this course we will use ggformula, which is built on top of ggplot2 (so the graphs you create will be ggplot objects and can be modified as such). However, the syntax ggformula uses to specify input variables and settings is a bit different than ggplot2. The differences are desirable to us because:\n\nWe like consistency: ggformula input syntax is more like that of the functions we’ll be using to fit models to data\nWe often create graphics with several layers: Overlaying one graph on top of another is a bit easier in ggformula than in ggplot\n\nBecause of the variety of graphics packages in use in the R ecosystem, it is highly recommended that you not do a web search to find code examples to produce a certain graph. This section, course notes, and other course materials should have all the examples that you need (and if not, request additions!). In particular, mixing together code from different graphics packages generally leads to confusing disasters.\n\n\nMotivation: Realize the Dream!\nFigures are a crucial tool for exploring your data and communicating what you learn from the data.\nWhether you are doing a quick check to assess basic features of a dataset or creating a key figure for an important presentation, the best practice is to work thoughtfully. You already learned about creating graphics by I.C.E.E:\n\nThe I.C.E.E. method:\n\nImagine how you want your graph to look, before you\nCode. Once you have the basic starting point,\nEvaluate your work, and\nElaborate (refine it).\n\nRepeat until the figure is as awesome as it needs to be.\nWhat’s the missing piece that we left for last? That’s right: the code. Not most important, but crucial.\nSpecifically, you will now focus on implementation – you have a plan in mind; now how can you do it in R?\nThis section provides a set of code examples and practice exercises, but leaves out the details of design already covered in previous sections. Here, the assumption is you know what you want, and just need the technique to create it.\nTreat this section like a reference manual: it’s more important that you know how to look stuff up here than that you spend lots of time on every topic, and you don’t need to memorize. Complete the first 4 sections if you are new to ggformula, and then refer to the others as needed and as time allows. Get used to using this site as a “manual” to look stuff up on demand.\nGraph types marked with an (o) and with their section header in italics are ones that are optional and/or more advanced - skip if you wish.",

It is often near the upper left-hand corner on US keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula shapes\nMost gf_ functions take a formula that describes the positional attributes of the plot. Using one of these functions with no arguments will show you the “shape” of the formula it requires.\n\n\nGetting help on formula shapes\nRun this code to see the formula shape for gf_point().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see that gf_point()’s formula has the shape y ~ x, so the y-variable name goes before the tilde and the x-variable name goes after. (Think: “y depends on x”. Another way to remember the order is y ~ x: the y-axis label appears farther left than the x-axis label.)\n\n\nOrder matters in formulas!\nReverse the roles of the variables, changing births ~ date to date ~ births.

The gf_density() and gf_dens() functions produce these plots (in slightly different ways): gf_density() plots are filled-in, while gf_dens() just plots a line showing the shape of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften density plots can be a nice way to show distributions of a quantitative variable for each category in a categorical variable. To do that, we add the fill input to a gf_density() call, with the form fill = ~ categorical_variable_name to change the color of the filled regions by category:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to change the color of the lines in a gf_dens() plot, you would use color instead of fill:",

    "text": "19.3 Study Design\nA crucial distinction is between two broad classes of research studies: observational studies and experimental studies.\nSide note: many students in the sciences find that the statistical definition of an “experimental study” doesn’t mesh perfectly with the definition of an “experiment” that they learn in science courses. If it helps, you can think of “experiment” keeping the colloquial meaning it has in your field, and think of “experimental study” as a technical statistical descriptor of a study (as we will learn it today).\nYou probably have prior knowledge or a good intuitive guess as to the difference between studies that are observational and experimental. We’ll review key concepts more later on, but to start, take a chance to assess your existing hunches. Study the infographic below with this distinction in mind: Does the infographic confirm, modify, or add nuance to your initial idea of how “observational” and “experimental” studies differ? As a bonus, the image also details a few kinds of studies within each broad class, and orders them in terms of the strength of evidence they can provide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Alternative\nYou may spend less time with this one - but here’s an alternative infographic covering much of the same information. It’s organized differently, but consistent - dive in if you’d like to review again!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to notice in this version is the emphasis on randomized experimental studies like clinical trials as a source of possible causal conclusions – the NIH notes that a randomized experiment has the best chance of allowing researchers to conclude that one thing causes another, while that is difficult to impossible in observational work. Why?\n\n\nWhy Randomization?\nRandomization is a key tactic for ensuring the results of an experimental study are reliable, and providing a strong basis for concluding that a particular treatment or intervention causes a certain outcome or result.\nRandomization means participants are assigned randomly to different “treatments;” they are randomly chosen to receive different assigned values of the key variable(s) that researchers are controlling or manipulating. If this procedure is not followed, then the different treatment groups may differ systematically in some important feature (like gender, motivation, initial health status - anything that might influence the outcome). Here’s one more video that explains the issue quite clearly, in the context of human randomized controlled trials:\n\n\nYou can also watch it outside the tutorial.\n\n\nRandom SAMPLE vs RANDOMIZATION\nCareful! Many students confuse random sampling with randomization, or use one term when they mean the other. Check your understanding: which is which?\n\n\nWhat is the difference between random sampling and randomization?\n\n Randomization has to do with how cases to study are randomly chosen from the population, while random sampling has to do with how already-chosen participants are randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups. Random sampling has to do with how cases to study are randomly chosen from the population, while randomization has to do with how already-chosen participants are randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups. It depends on the context; they are very similar\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solution above.\n\nThe words seem similar, but are distinct technical terms!\nRandomization has to do with how values of a “treatment” variable of special interest are assigned: randomly!\nRandom sampling means that the individuals (whether they are people, places, or things…) in the study were selected from the population at random.",

This is especially true if you use the data to lead you from a more complex to a simpler model. As Harrell (2015) points out in section 4.3, the problems are huge:\nHow can we avoid these problems?

    "text": "20.4 Dataset Size (n/15 rule)\nOne important consideration, when planning a regression model, is: How many predictors can I reasonably include?\nIt depends on the size of the dataset: it takes several observations to get a good estimate of any statistics, so it makes sense that fitting a model with lots of predictors will require a bigger dataset. Each additional observation may add a little bit more capacity for fitting a more complex model.\nAnd if you try to fit too many, the chances of overfitting increase. Overfitting is when you model noise as well as signal, capturing in your model apparent relationships that actually exist only in the current dataset, not in reality.\nFor linear regression, Harrell (2015, Chapter 4.6) offers a rule of thumb: the number of parameters being estimated, \\(p\\), should be less than \\(\\frac{n}{10}\\) or \\(\\frac{n}{20}\\). To give just one standard rule of thumb, we should aim for \\(p &lt; \\frac{n}{15}\\). \\(n\\) is the sample size (number of rows in the dataset).\nThis “n/15 rule” is a very rough rule of thumb - sometimes it seems you can get away with estimating a few more parameters than it says, and sometimes fewer (particularly in the case of categorical predictors where the observations are not evenly distributed across combinations of categories). But it gives us a reality check and a starting point for planning.\nRemember, n/15 is a ceiling – and upper limit on the number of parameters you could estimate. It’s not a goal! You may have less.",

    "text": "20.5 Causation Revisited\nIn most intro stat courses, students learn to repeat statements like: “Correlation doesn’t imply causation, and only randomized experimental studies can draw causal conclusions.”\nWell…kind of.\nIn data science, big observational datasets (collected in the absense of a structured study design) are really common. There are also many scenarios of interest where randomized experiments are just not possible on practical and ethical grounds.\nSome blatant examples: experiments in which people were randomly assigned to dislocate their shoulders to investigate factors influencing recovery, or start smoking to see if they get cancer, or expose themselves to someone with a contagious disease to see if they become ill. In many situations, observational work is the only real option. What’s a researcher to do?\nIn recent decades the field of causal inference has made great strides in thinking intelligently about how best to make the most reliable conclusions possible about cause and effect, when observational data is all you have. To begin to understand, we have to define a few terms: direct causation vs. indirect causation, and three alternative situations: confounders, mediators, and colliders. This field is new and technical, but the next video is about the most concise and clear primer I know of (with concrete examples).\n\n\nYou may also watch it outside this tutorial.\n\nMediators, Moderators, Precision Covariates\nOK, wait a sec. The video didn’t cover mediators! A mediator is another term for what the video called an “indirect cause” – a link in the middle of a causal chain. The mediator explains or is part of the process by which an upstream cause leads to an effect.\nThere are two other variable types it may be useful to name, too:\n\nPrecision covariates affect the response variable of interest, without having any causal links at all to the “main” predictor of interest. We include them in models when we can, to get more precise estimates.\nModerators interact with the main predictor of interest. The cause-effect relationship between the main predictor and the response varies depending on the value of the moderator variable. (Moderators might additionally affect the predictor and/or the response directly, so they may share some features with precision covariates and confounders.)",

    "text": "20.6 What’s a Causal Diagram?\nA causal diagram is a picture mapping the causal relationships between key variables. They are used when researchers are interested in quantifying causal relationships between variables – not just, “is X associated with a change in Y?” but “does X cause a change in Y?”\nTo make causal conclusions with confidence outside the context of a randomized, controlled experimental study is a big challenge, and mapping out starting assumptions about relationships between variables is just the first part.\nEven if we are not necessarily trying to make causal conclusions (we won’t be here, with observational data), when you model relationships of several variables, a causal diagram helps you make smart, thoughtful choices about the ones you include in your model and the ones you leave out.\nThe diagram surfaces your starting assumptions about relationships between variables. It makes your assumptions transparent (to others and to you!) and guides choices about what to include/exclude from a model.\nPeople also call causal diagrams DAGs (for Directed Acyclic Graphs) since they are a specific application of that [broader] type of mathematical graph. So, every causal diagram is a DAG, but in math there can be DAGs that are not statistical causal diagrams.\nIn a causal diagram each box is a variable, and arrows connect causes to effects (with the arrowhead pointing from the cause to the effect).",

If using a server, you’ll need to upload the image, but then you can pretty easily include your image in a Quarto file.\nIf you’d like to create your diagrams in R, you might want to consider using mermaid or graphviz diagrams, which Quarto supports.\nAnother somewhat popular option is the R package dagitty, although take care (its diagrams are not quite as pretty or customizable, and it sometimes throws inscrutable errors because of buried conflicts with other packages we use).\nYou are welcome to explore these options if you’re motivated, but hand-drawn diagrams are fine for our course – for us, the point is not making camera-ready diagrams, but using diagrams to plan our models well.",

    "text": "20.8 Variable Types\nIn a multi-variable analysis, there is often one key variable of interest (measuring “response” or “outcome” or “effect”) and another one which may influence it, and is the focus of greatest research interest (a key “predictor” or “cause”).\nBut there are generally other variables in the mix that are somehow relevant to understanding the predictor – response relationship. How can we classify (and diagram) them?\nIn all examples below, X is the predictor of greatest interest and Y is the response. (A is the other variable.) The definitions below all depend on a specific X and Y having been chosen: the other variable types are defined relative to the X-Y relationship.\n\nPrecision Covariate\nHere’s an example of A acting as a precision covariate. Precision covariates are also known as competing exposures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the diagram, can you explain in words what a precision covariate is?\n\n\nClick for one definition…\n\nA precision covariate affects only the response variable.\n\nBest practice is to include precision covariates in a model trying to measure the size of the effect of X on Y, to get the most precise estimates possible…but if you don’t, it won’t bias your estimate of the size of X’s influence on Y. Can you explain why?\n\n\nMediator\nHere are two (slightly different) examples of A acting as a mediator. Based on the diagram (and the code), explain in words what a mediator is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the diagrams, can you explain in words what a mediator is?\n\n\nClick for one definition…\n\nA mediator is part of a chain of causes and effects, between the main predictor of interest and the response.\n(You may also see mediation chains elsewhere in a diagram/scenario…for example, a chain of three causes/effects that together act as a precision covariate.)\n\nHow is this different from a precision covariate?\n\n\nHmm, not sure – show me how it’s different!\n\nA mediator is part of a chain of causes and effects, between the main predictor of interest and the response.\nIt affects the response, but unlike a precision covariate, it’s also affected by the predictor of interest.\n\nIf you have a situation like the first picture above, where there are no branches/only one single path from your predictor to the response, include only your predictor and that’s it.\nBUT if there are mediator(s) and if there are branches in the path(s), like the second picture above that’s when you have options.\nIf you want to estimate the total effect of the upstream predictor of interest, exclude the mediator(s). If you want to distinguish and quantify effects along several pathways (via the mediator in question, and another way), then include one variable along each branch whose influence you want to measure.\nBoth can be valid. Researchers have to choose which they want to do.\n\n\nConfounder\nBelow is another causal diagram, in which A is a confounder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you define “confounder” in words?\n\n\nClick for one definition…\n\nA confounder affects both the predictor and the response.\n\nIf there is a confounder present and you do not include it in your model, then you may wrongly conclude X causes Y.\nSo best practice is to include all confounders in a model.\n\n\nCollider\nCollider bias caused by collider variable A looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collider is affected by both the predictor and response. (Their influence arrows “collide” at the collider…)\nIncluding a collider in a model designed to measure association between X and Y can induce association where there is actually none so best practice is to make sure you do not include colliders in models.\n\n\nModerator\nA variable that moderates (increases or decreases the size of) the causal link between two other variables is a Moderator.\n(If you have studied interactions before in the context of regression models, a cause and a moderator interact to influence the effect.)\nUnfortunately in our diagrams there is not really an adequate way to draw moderators – for good reasons – but here’s a diagram (from Yoon 2020) to help get a sense of the situation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you have a moderator variable, best practice is to include it in your model interacting with X. (We will return to interactions in much more detail later on.)\n\n\nMore\nThere are more details and more complicated scenarios, of course. This is all you need to master to start with.

    "text": "20.10 Summary: Causal Diagrams\nSoooo….what? How will this affect our work? Well, we will often be interested in the association or relationship between two key variables, a potential cause or “predictor” x and a potential effect or “response” y. Unless we have data from a randomized experimental study, we need to be clever about which other variables to include in our analysis to get the best, most accurate estimate of the x - y relationship:\n\nIf there are any confounders we should include them in our models and analysis. This is often called controlling for the confounders’ effects.\nIf there is a mediator, you may have a choice.\n\nIf there are no branches/only one single path from your predictor to the response, include only your predictor and that’s it.\nIf there are branches in the path, that’s when you have options. If you want to estimate the total effect of the upstream predictor of interest, exclude the mediator(s). If you want to distinguish and quantify effects along several pathways (via the mediator in question, and another way), then include one variable along each branch whose influence you want to measure.\n\nIf there are any colliders they should not be included in our models and analysis - including them would actually reduce the accuracy of our assessment of the x - y relationship\n\nSeems simple enough, right? There’s a catch. To decide whether something might be a collider or a confounder, you have to rely on your knowledge or belief about what causes what. Even experts don’t always agree. There is not usually a definite right answer that is easy to agree on. This is one thing that makes causal inference with observational data so hard, and contentious!\nBut closing your eyes to the issue and skipping the step of making a causal diagram doesn’t solve anything at all. Whatever model you fit is consistent with some causal diagrams, and not others. So by drawing the diagram as best you can, and designing your model accordingly, you are being transparent and explicit about your assumptions instead of keeping yourself and your audience ignorant that those assumptions exist, and have consequences.\nMy personal advice is: if in doubt, and if the data allow it, control for all the potentially important variables you can. The exception, of course, if is you are sure or quite sure the variable is a collider - in that case you definitely MUST exclude it.",

    "text": "21.5 Multiple Predictors\nOften, statisticians consider more than one \\(x\\) variable. Why? Well, most response variables we are interested are associated with not just one but many different variables – in the language we just learned, many variables could be potential causes, confounders, mediators, or moderators (but not colliders…because we would not put those in the model).\nWith multiple predictors, the linear regression equation looks more like\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots \\beta_p x_p + \\varepsilon\\] \\[\\varepsilon \\sim \\text{Norm}(0, \\sigma)\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is the response variable value,\nthe \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept,\n\\(\\beta_1, \\dots \\beta_p\\) are the \\(p\\) “slopes”,\n\\(x\\)s are the \\(p\\) predictor variable values, and\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) are the “errors” (since real data doesn’t all fall exactly on a line).\n\nWhen we use data to estimate the \\(\\beta_i\\)’s, we may write it this way:\n\\[ \\hat Y = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_2 + \\dots \\hat{\\beta}_p x_p\\]\n\nThe hats on top of the the \\(\\beta\\)s and \\(Y\\) indicate that they are being estimated from data (they are statistics or estimates rather than parameters now!)\nNote that the error term is gone now: we know exactly what our estimate \\(\\hat Y\\) is, with no error.\n\nBut \\(\\hat Y\\) isn’t (usually) identical to \\(Y\\). The difference is our friend the residual:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mbox{residual} = \\hat\\varepsilon & = Y - \\hat Y \\\\\n& = \\mbox{observed reponse} - \\mbox{model response}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAgain, the hats indicate that we are making estimates using data (hats basically always mean this in statistics). Those “beta hat” and “Y hat” values come from our fitted model. The \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s are called the coefficients (or, more precisely, the estimated coefficients) or the “beta hats”.\n\nYou will sometimes encounter slightly different notation for linear models. Two common things are:\n\nThe use of \\(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_p\\) instead of \\(\\hat \\beta_0, \\hat \\beta_1, \\dots \\hat \\beta_p\\).\nDropping of hats. In particular, the hat is often left off of the response variable when the model is presented with the numerical coefficient estimates plugged in.\n\nAnd the models themselves go by different names: regression model, least squares model, least squares regression model, etc.\nDon’t let these little differences distract you. If you focus on the important concepts, you should be able to navigate the notation, whichever way someone does it.",

The \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) up there (capitalized because it’s a random variable) is a vector, not a scalar – it’s a list of \\(n\\) response variable values. Same for the data.

Or, we might want to test whether it is associated with changes in the response or not.\n\nSee if you can express a scientific question which can be answered by your linear regression model.\n\nFor example, a model with formula ELL2012 ~ ELL2005 would answer, “Does the proportion of kids with elevated lead levels in a county in 2005 predict the proportion in 2012? (Do the same locations have high/low levels in the two years?)”\n\nDon’t forget to consider your understanding of causal relationships between variables of interest in planning your model - consdier drawing a causal diagram to help you decide which predictors should be included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercepts\nA (potentially non-zero) intercept is always included in all lm() models, by default.\nIf you wish, you can specifically tell R to include it (which doesn’t change the default behavior, but just makes it explicit). You do this by using a right-hand-side formula like 1 + predictor:\n\nmy_model &lt;- lm(ELL2012 ~ 1 + ELL2005, data = MI_lead)\n\n\n\nOmitting the Intercept\nYou can omit estimation of an intercept by replacing that 1 with a 0 or a -1. This will force the intercept to be 0 (line goes through the origin).\nThe 0 makes sense to me, because it’s like you’re forcing the first column of the model matrix to contain zeros instead of ones, multiplying the intercept by 0 to force it to be 0.\n(I’m not sure of the logic of the -1.)\nFor example,\n\nmy_model &lt;- lm(ELL2012 ~ 0 + ELL2005 + Peninsula,\n               data = MI_lead)\n\nBut usually, we want to estimate an intercept and we don’t need this code.",

    "text": "22.8 Checking Independence\nIndependence of residuals means that knowing the value of one residual does not help you to predict the value of the next residual.\nWhen data are collected over time and space, sometimes the residuals are not independent over time (or space) – for example, maybe series of positive residuals tend to occur together, or series of negative residuals together. How can we detect this kind of non-independence?\nFirst, make sure that your dataset is sorted in order of time (if you are worried about non-independence over time) or space (if you are worried about possible non-independence over space). (The lead dataset is already sorted in temporal order - you can verify this by looking at the variable Decimal_Date.)\nThe autocorrelation function will help us.\nThis function computes a value akin to a correlation coefficient for the dataset, indicating how much it is correlated with itself at different “lags”. What does this mean?\nLag 0 is the correlation of the data with itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course the correlation at lag 0 is ALWAYS 1: the dataset is identical with itself.\nWhat about larger lags?\nTo compute the ACF at lag 1, we slide one copy of the dataset forward one observation, and compute the correlation again:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells us how well we can predict one observation in the data, based on the preceding observation.\nLag 2 scoots the data one more position:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…And so on.\nOutside this website, you can plot the ACF for many lags using the function s245::gf_acf(~fitted_model). (Here we have used acf(), but it will make a non-ggplot/non-ggformula type plot that is a little less pretty.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe horizontal dotted lines are approximate 95% confidence boundaries for how large the ACF values (for lags greater than 0) should be, if the data are really independent.\nIn general, to verify the independence condition of linear regression, we want to confirm that not many of the ACF values for lags greater than 0 exceed those horizontal “fences” by very much. (One or two ACF values that just barely “poke above the fence” is not a major violation, especially as it is known that the method used to determine the “fences” is known to be a bit too conservative – even independent data will have ACF values that pass them more than 5% of the time.)\nIn the plot above, all the “spikes” are within the “fences”, so there is no indication of non-independence in the residuals (given the current sort order of the data).",

The authors worked with 117 bonobos in European zoos and recorded data including their Sex, Age in years, weight, and some measurements about their face:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, they also measured each bonobo’s assertiveness score (AssR) and dominance score (normDS).\nThe dataset is at https://sldr.netlify.app/data/bonobo_faces.csv and so you could read the dataset in to R by running:\n\nbonobos &lt;- readr::read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/bonobo_faces.csv')\n\n\n\nPractice\nWe might wonder whether size (as measured by weight) is a good predictor of the dominance score, normDS. Graphically:\n\ngf_point(normDS ~ weight, data = bonobos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFit the corresponding regression model in R and view its summary(). Note, the dataset bonobos is already read in for you here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the blanks with the right formula, dataset name, and fitted model object name!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nbonobo_lm &lt;- lm(normDS ~ weight, data = bonobos)\nsummary(bonobo_lm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the intercept estimate for the model you just fitted?\n\n 1.031 0.926 2.008 0.011 0.023\n\nWhat is the slope for the model you just fitted?\n\n 0.011 2.008 1.031 0.926 0.023\n\nWhat is sigma, the standard deviation of the residuals, for the model you just fitted?\n\n 0.023 2.008 0.926 0.011 1.031\n\n\n\n\n\nSE of Sampling Distributions\n\nAs you may have noticed, the summary() of an lm() (or glmmTMB()) regression model fit includes not only estimates of the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), but also the standard errors of the corresponding sampling distributions! (Hooray.) These measure the standard deviation we’d expect to see in our parameter estimates from sample to sample, if we were somehow able to collect data many many times. They can be used to calibrate our uncertainty in our estimates of the \\(\\beta\\)s, and they are found in the coefficient table, labelled \"Std.

If we can reject that null hypothesis, we can conclude that the predictor does have some utility.\nTo practice, you could carry out a two-sided test of \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) for the bonobo regression as shown in the hints below (if you learned R in your intro stat course and remember your intro stat pretty well).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nnormDS_model &lt;- lm(normDS ~ weight, data= bonobos)\nsummary(normDS_model)\nt_stat &lt;- (-0.14278 - 0) / (0.06668)\np_val &lt;- 2 * pt(t_stat, df = nrow(bonobos) - 2, lower.tail = TRUE)\np_val\n\n\n\n\nORRRR…A shortcut (which you can take!): Notice that this p-value is already in the model summary (in the last column of the coefficient table, labelled “Pr(\\(&gt;\\vert\\)t\\(\\vert\\))“).\n\n#shortcut: just use model summary\nnormDS_model &lt;- lm(normDS ~ weight, data= bonobos)\nsummary(normDS_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = normDS ~ weight, data = bonobos)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.3794 -0.8138 -0.2354  0.6043  2.0207 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The p-value of this test measures the strength of evidence in our data against the null hypothesis of no association. Smaller p-values can be considered stronger evidence (and ones bigger than ~0.05-0.1 give weak to no evidence against the null).\nHere, the p-values is really, really big (about 0.6), so we have no evidence against the null hypothesis of no association between a bonobo’s weight and normDS score.\nBut that doesn’t mean we can’t conclude anything!\nConcluding “we have no evidence, based on this data, of any association between weight and dominance score” is an answer to the question of whether they are associated. The answer just seems to be…no.",

    "text": "24.2 Case Study: Gratitude\nA growing body of research has documented the effects that practicing gratitude can have on people – providing not just spiritual and mental-health benefits, but even improving physical health.\n\n\n\nDataset\nWe will dive further into this topic – learning about ANOVA and some other tests along the way – via a case study where researchers tried to collect data to answer:\n“How does gratitude affect peoples’ mental and physical well-being?”\nThe data are simulated based on the results of a paper published in 2003:\n\n\n\nCan We Induce Gratitude?\nTo understand whether gratitude can cause improvements in mental and physical health and practices, the researchers needed to do a randomized study, in which they somehow controlled peoples’ gratitude levels. How did they do that?\nFirst, they recruited nearly 200 college students to participate in their study.\nThey asked participants to complete a weekly journal, writing lists of things that they were grateful for. 1/3 of study participants were randomly assigned to this group - the gratitude group.\nOther participants were asked to write about things that annoyed them instead – this was the hassles group.\nFinally, a control group – the events group – just wrote about events in the past week that had affected them (could be either positive or negative).\nBefore delving into any other questions, the researchers had to verify that the gratitude group actually felt more grateful than the other groups…\n\n\nMore Design Details\nIn addition to the journals, all the students had to complete weekly surveys about their behavior and state of mind.\nFor example, they had to state how often (on a scale of 1 to 5) they experienced each of a set of feelings over the preceding week:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPulling out Gratitude\nThe researchers combined scores from the words thankful, appreciative, and grateful to assess participants’ gratitude. In our dataset, this value is called gratitude_score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Data\nHow do the data actually look?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like perhaps the gratitude_score is higher for the gratitude group and lower for the others, but we really need statistical inference to have more confidence in our judgment of whether the difference is real or if the differences between groups could just be the result of random sampling variation.\n\n\nOur Questions\nAs Emmons and McCullough did, our first job will be to test whether the mean gratitude_score is the same for the different groups in the study – the gratitude group, the hassles group, and the events group.\nTo build up to the question we want to answer (comparing all three groups), we will consider a simplified case with only two groups: the gratitude and hassles groups. This is only for learning purposes and not something we’d do in a real analysis!\nWe also have other potential quantitative predictors in the dataset we could include in our models. We will take advantage of that to review CIs and tests for a quantitative predictor, too.\n\n\nReview: Quantitative Predictors\nFor example, we could consider a model to predict gratitude_score as a function of life_rating (a score measuring positivity about one’s life as a whole).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlife_model &lt;- lm(gratitude_score ~ life_rating, \n                 data = grateful)\nsummary(life_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gratitude_score ~ life_rating, data = grateful)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-4.891 -1.466 -0.098  1.219  5.899 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

What is the p-value of the test?\n\n 4.22e-14 0.00377 0.0424 Something else\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical?\n\nIf we consider a categorical variable with only two categories, everything is exactly the same (except the interpretation of the slope coefficient, which now gives the difference in means between the two categories).\nFor example, we can reduce the dataset to exclude the third events group, and then model gratitude_score as a function of group to see if the gratitude and hassles groups have different average gratitude scores.\nOf course we would never normally do this! But right now, for learning purposes, we could use a categorical variable with 2 categories…and ours has three. So don’t try this filtering/subsetting at home!\n\ngrateful2 &lt;- grateful |&gt;\n  filter(group != 'events') |&gt;\n  mutate(group = factor(group))\ngf_boxplot(gratitude_score ~ group, \n           data = grateful2,\n           orientation = \"x\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\nFit the model and, just as in the previous example, find a 95% CI for \\(\\beta_1\\) and test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\ntwo_group_model &lt;- lm(gratitude_score ~ group, \n                      data = grateful2)\nsummary(two_group_model)\n# if you wanted to pull out just the p-value (advanced move)\ncoefficients(summary(two_group_model))['grouphassles', 'Pr(&gt;|t|)']\n\n\n\n\nEasy peasy! As we mentioned before, the only real difference between this model and the one with a quantitative predictor is that we end up with an indicator variable instead of one with many different numeric values, so the interpretation of the slope coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) is different.\n\n\nIn our model to compare the gratitude and hassles groups, the grouphassles coefficient estimate is about -1.54. What does this mean?\n\n The mean gratitude_score is 1.54 units lower in the hassles group than in the gratitude group. When the amount of 'hassles' increases by one unit, the gratitude_score goes down by 1.54 units. Something else The mean gratitude score is 1.54 units higher in the hassles group than in the gratitude group. The mean gratitude_score for people in the hassles group is -1.54.\n\n\n\nBut what if we have a categorical predictor with MORE THAN TWO categories? We need a test that incorporates differences between all the categories at once, so the tools we have so far aren’t enough.",

And we know that the bigger it is, the stronger the evidence we have against the idea that the categorical predictor is not associated with the response.\nBut…how big will it be, even if there is no association?\n\n\nIf the null hypothesis is true, what will the value of the F-ratio be?\n\n It depends… Close to 0 Very Large Close to 1\n\nIf the population group means are actually very different, with little variation within groups, what will the value of the F-ratio be?\n\n Close to 0 It depends… Very Large Close to 1\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for more explanations…\n\nIf \\(H_0\\) is true, then SSG may be ‘close to 0’ because the group means will be very close to the overall mean. So, MSG and the whole F-ratio will also be near 0 - but since it MSG is not exactly zero, it matters a lot what the corresponding value of MSE is…\nF will be close to 1 if the null is true and the sample sizes in the groups are equal. MSE and MSG will BOTH depend on the overall variance of the data. In terms of intuition about the F ratio, though, it can be more useful to think about what happens to MSG when \\(H_0\\) is true (it gets smaller, and so so does F…). Bigger F is more evidence against \\(H_0\\).\nIf \\(H_0\\) is very wrong, then SSG will be relatively large because the group means will be quite different from the overall mean. And SSE will be relatively small, if there is little within-group variation. So the ratio will be (big / small) = VERY BIG, providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis and allowing us to conclude that the group means are NOT the same.\n\nAgain, we know that a large value of F will let us reject the null. But how big is “large”?\nWe’d need to know the sampling distribution of F (when \\(H_0\\) is true) in order to judge.",

    "text": "24.5 ANOVA: Practical Process\n\nLetting R do all the Work\n\nWe won’t go into the details of the calculation here; we’ll just note that there’s an R function to automate it all.\n\n\nAnova Table (Type II tests)\n\nResponse: gratitude_score\n          Sum Sq  Df F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \ngroup      82.30   2  11.152 2.612e-05 ***\nResiduals 712.15 193                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nBut notice – all the quantities that we used in our derivation of the F-statistic are right there in the ANOVA output table!\n\nThe “group” row gives the SSG and its df (and the F stat and p-value)\nThe “Residuals” row gives the SSE and its df. (Residuals is another statistical term for errors.)\nThe “Sum Sq” column corresponds to “SS” terms (“MS” terms are not in the table, but can be computed from SSX and df from the table)\nThe “F value” is the F-ratio (test statistic)\nThe “Pr(&gt;F)” is the p-value of the test\n\n(A classic intro-stat textbook ANOVA problem is to give you a partially-filled-in ANOVA results table, and ask you to fill in the missing values.)\n\n\nInterpretation of ANOVA for Regression\nSo…how do we interpret the results we get from anova() then?\nIn the gratitude example, we could safely assume there were no confounders since it was a controlled experiment, so it was valid to fit a model with only the one predictor group – any other variables could only be mediators or precision covariates, so it would not bias our results to omit them.\nBut it would probably also be fair to argue that life_rating and illness_score and exercise_hours might all be precision covariates, also affecting gratitude scores (but not group of course). So we could fit a model including them. Then our ANOVA table would look like:\n\n\nAnova Table (Type II tests)\n\nResponse: gratitude_score\n               Sum Sq  Df F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \ngroup           59.96   2  8.2764 0.0003578 ***\nlife_rating     21.61   1  5.9656 0.0155026 *  \nillness_score    0.72   1  0.1983 0.6566361    \nexercise_hours   1.38   1  0.3823 0.5370973    \nResiduals      688.21 190                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nSo how would we interpret that?\nOur key predictor of interest was group. With a p-value of about 0.0004, we have very strong evidence that group is associated with gratitude score. (To present that result well, we’d want to also say which group had higher or lower scores and by how much – for that, we could use a prediction plot or the model equation.)\nWe also have moderately strong evidence that life_rating is associated with gratitude score. Again, to know in what direction and how much, we could use the equation or a prediction plot…give it a try!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nbigger_model &lt;- lm(gratitude_score ~ group + life_rating + \n                illness_score + exercise_hours,\n              data = grateful)\nsummary(bigger_model)\npredict_response(bigger_model, terms = \"life_rating\") |&gt; plot()\nWe see that gratitude scores go up by about 0.5 units for every one-unit increase in life rating. That corresponds to the slope of 0.43.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not to “select” a “best” model\nThe p-values for the other predictors (illness and exercise) are very large, so we actually have no evidence that those predictors are actually associated with gratitude scores.\nWait…does that mean we should stop and fit a new “reduced” model without those two predictors because it would be “better” somehow, and report those results instead of the full model?\nNOPE, please don’t!\nIf your model plan includes certain predictors, that’s because you thought at the outset they were or should be or could be associated with the response and wanted to measure or account for their effect. If you later remove them to get a “better” model, your final model will underestimate uncertainty and be biased toward p-values and CIs that are too small, for the predictors that are retained. Remember, our process is to plan well, then fit and interpret ONE MODEL. Don’t put things in and out later on based on what you find, if at all possible.\nDon’t believe me; or, want to read more about this? Optionally, consider checking out:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3336\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/e26060506\nBook: Model Selection and Multimodel Inference by Burnham & Anderson\nAnother perspective that suggests similar principles probably hold in Bayesian models and maybe some predictive models: https://mc-stan.org/loo/articles/online-only/faq.html#modelselection\n\n\n\nR Note: Anova(), not anova()!\nBe careful not to use anova() to carry out tests related to predictors in a regression model.\nanova() does “sequential” tests; for example, if you fit a model y ~ pred1 + pred2 + pred3, for pred1 anova() will compare the intercept-only model to the one with pred1 in it, but for pred2 it will compare the model with pred1 and pred2 in it to the one with only pred2, and for pred3 it will compare the model with all three predictors to the one without pred3. ACK!\nIn other words, with anova(), the order in which predictors are listed greatly affects the hypotheses tested, and the test results. THIS IS (ALMOST ALWAYS) NONSENSE. You want Anova() which is in the package car.\n\n\nOther Model Comparisons\nIn other cases, if we want to compare two particular models with the same response variable but different predictors, we can just fit them both and then compare them with the syntax below.\n\nanova(model1, model2)\n\n(Yes, little-a anova() is what you want this time.)\nWhy might we want to do this? Maybe, for example, you have two different predictors that measure a similar quantity in different ways and you want to know which one works better as a predictor? In that case, Anova() won’t work because neither model is a subset of the other - for these comparisons of non-nested models fitting each model and then using anova() to compare the two will work.\nThis anova(model1, model2) approach also works for any of the above cases (removing parameters in sets of nested models), if you manually fit the two models…it’s just a bit more work.",

(Common thresholds are 2, 3, or maybe 6). So, one might not prefer a larger model unless it reduces AIC by at least 2-3 units.\nSo, if we are comparing two models (say, with and without a key predictor of interest), if the model with the predictor is better by well over 2-3 AIC units, we consider that pretty convincing evidence of an association between that predictor and the response.\nFor a lot more excellent information about practical use of AIC, the interested reader can check out the classic book by Burnham and Anderson:",

    "text": "25.5 SET Examples\nWe need to see some more examples of this. To do so, let’s consider a dataset called teach_beauty, on course evaluation scores (eval) for a lot of university professors. You can find a copy of the dataset at: https://sldr.netlify.app/data/ProfEvaltnsBeautyPublic.csv.\nThese data are included in a textbook by Andrew Gelman of Columbia University, and they might be real course evaluations from Columbia (or they might be simulated; we’re not sure).\nSome additional information is given about each faculty member, including\n\nwhether their native language is English or something else: native_language\na ranking of their beauty (somehow, we don’t know how)\ntheir age\nwhether they tended to dress in a formal way\nwhether or not they are female\nwhether or not they are White/Caucasian (race_eth)\n\nA bunch of research has suggested that scores from student evaluations of teaching (SETs) don’t really measure teaching skill well (for example, Spooren et al. 2013, Hornstein 2017, and Kreitzer & Sweet-Cushman 2022). So, it could be interesting to consider what they do actually measure…and a number of studies have found discrepancies in which faculty who are younger, female, and more tend to get lower scores.\nHere, we will not dive into a full model plan and causal diagram, but just play with and explore a few example model to help deepen our understanding of how interactions work.\nSince we’re doing “night science” and not focused on later inference, we can take a peek at the data. Feel free to make some additional graphs if you like!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical-Quantitative Interaction\nThat graph you just saw might show evidence of an interaction…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEval may go up as beauty increases, but the slope of the relationship seems like it might be different for the female group.\nThis would be an interaction between beauty and female.\n\n\nCategorical-Categorical Interaction\nWe just saw an interaction between categorical and quantitative variables. What about a categorical variable modulating the effect of another categorical variable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps Informal Dress affects eval scores, but really only if the teacher is not female – for females, formal dress doesn’t make a difference either way.\nThe effect of formal dress is different depending on the value of female. This is an interaction between formal and female.\n\n\nQuant-Quant interactions?\nYes, these are possible, but very hard to visualize and conceptualize.\nBasically, it would mean that the slope of the line for one predictor changes gradually as the value of a second variable changes.\nIn other words, the response variable depends not only on each of the two predictors, but also on their product.\nYou’ll see one example later on, but generally I recommend you initially avoid interactions of two quantitative variables unless you are pretty sure you need one and have confidence in your ability to interpret the result.\n\n\nR code\nIf you want to include an interaction term in a model in R, in the model forumla, use a * rather than a + between the predictors that (may) interact. For example, consistent with our exploration above, we might try:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the additional indicator variables in the coefficient table/model equation. These function to adjust the effects of the beauty predictor depending on the values of formal and female, which interact with it. (More details on that equation-y stuff later.)\nWe could use IC-based model selection to determine whether including these interactions in a model is important or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the particular model we fitted, the “best” model starting from this full model is actually one without interactions. If you want to explore the dataset further, you will find that actually a model where age, beauty AND female interact fits much better…I encourage you to give that a try!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionary note\nIf you include an interaction in a regression model, you must also include the corresponding “fixed effects” – this means if you have an indicator variable/slope term for an interaction in your model, you must also have the indicator variables/slopes corresponding to the individual predictors. Our fitting functions (lm(), glm(), glmmTMB(), etc.) are smart enough to ensure this for you. So is dredge(). (It would take effort to mess this up in R.)",

    "text": "25.6 Bee Examples\nIt’s nearly impossible to have too many examples when introducing the idea of interactions. So let’s see some more…\nWe will use data from a 2019 paper by Adam Dolezal and colleagues, entitled Interacting stressors matter: diet quality and virus infection in honeybee health (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.181803). Its abstract reads:\n\n\nHoneybee population declines have been linked to multiple stressors, including reduced diet diversity and increased exposure to understudied viruses. Despite interest in these factors, few experimental studies have explored the interaction between diet diversity and viral infection in honeybees… In laboratory experiments, we found that high-quality diets have the potential to reduce mortality in the face of infection with Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV).\n\n\nYou can find a copy of the dataset at: https://sldr.netlify.app/data/bee-virus.csv. Here, we could read in and prepare the data like so:\n\nbees &lt;- readr::read_csv('data/bee-virus.csv', show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  rename(Cage_id = `Cage Number`,\n         Virus = `Virus Treatment`,\n         Food = `Pollen Treatment`,\n         Experiment_id = `Experimental replicate code`,\n         Mortality = `72 hpi proportion mortality`) |&gt;\n  drop_na(Virus, Food, Mortality)\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical-Quantitative Interaction\nWhat would it mean for the effect of Virus and the effect of Food to interact?\nHere’s a graphical exploration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf food is “None” that is low-quality food with no pollen added (the other kinds have pollen, with “Poly” being the highest quality).\nSome cages were infected with a virus, and some were not.\nDo bees on different diets take a different survival hit when infected with the virus? We’d need to fit some models to find out!\nBefore we go further…\n\n\nWhat would it mean for the bees’ diet to modulate the effect of the virus on the bees? (If you’re struggling, refer to the data graph shown earlier, which may help you to understand…)\n\n An interaction between diet and virus means that diet and virus affect one another, that is, they are associated with each other None of the above Diet and virus interact if the effect of the virus on bee mortality rates is BIGGER for some diet(s) than others. Both diet AND virus infection have effects on the number of bees that die\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solution above.\n\nAn interaction means that the proportion of bees killed by virus infection depends on the diet they are eating.\nHere, we might think that bees eating the best food are better able to survive infection, while those with the lowest quality of the food die more once infected.\nAll bees die more with virus than without, but the jump (proportion of extra death when the virus infection is present) is much bigger when the food is bad.\nIt’s not correct to say that “interaction means diet and virus are associated with each other…” Yikes! Sorry, no. This is a very common misconception. Two predictors ARE sometimes associated with each other. But whether they are or not, that is NOT an interaction. An interaction is when the value of one predictor ALTERS the relationship between the other predictor and the response variable.\nIt’s also not complete to say that there’s interaction if “both diet AND virus infection have effects on the number of bees that die.” This answer answer doesn’t describe an interaction – this could just describe an additive model, where diet and virus both affect mortality.\n\nOK! Let’s go ahead and fit that model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEek. What does it all mean?\n\n\nSelection: ANOVA\nYou’ll see some examples of how to write and understand the model equation a bit later. But for this example, let’s think about how we would make inferences – for example, how could we test whether Virus and Food really interact?\nOne approach would use ANOVA; see if you can code it…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nbee_int_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ ____ * ____, data = bees)\ncar::Anova(...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nbee_int_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus * Food, data = bees)\ncar::Anova(bee_int_model)\n\n\n\n\nBased on the ANOVA results, do we have evidence that Virus and Food interact?\nWait…before you answer that…",

(Remember, for regression models, the null is usually “there is no association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\),” or maybe today, “there is no interaction between \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\).”)\n\nThe smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence; and p-values above about 0.05-0.1 are essentially no evidence against the null hypothesis.\n\n\nFor different practitioners, and in different contexts, different scales for strength-of-evidence provided by p-values have been suggested.\nIn A reckless guide to p-values Michael Lew discusses the history and practical application of p-values at length and suggests that “Strength of evidence against the null hypothesis scales semi-geometrically with the smallness of the P-value” as shown in his Figure 3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternately, in In defense of p-values, Paul Murtaugh suggests:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese should give you an idea of how to interpret p-values and draw conclusion from them, but a key point is to avoid memorizing some algorithm or rule to decide whether or not you have a “significant” result, and to avoid summarizing results with that single word – so, we do not simply say a conclusion is “significant” if it is based on a p-value below 0.05 (again, the words are crossed out for emphasis!) There are lots of reasons – see the articles linked above by Murtaugh and Lew if you want to read more.\nSo what do we say, if we are avoiding the fraught shorthand of calling it “significant”?\nA key best practice is to accompany all hypothesis testing results with a discussion of the “effect size” – for example, how big is the slope, or the difference between groups? Try to consider whether the size of the estimated difference is big enough to be of practical importance.\nNow, back to our question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the ANOVA results, do we have evidence that Virus and Food interact?\n\n Nope, most definitely NOT Some; with a p-value of about 0.02, the evidence is moderate but not completely compelling Yes, I'm basically sure There is significant evidence (p &lt; 0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solution above.\n\nThe p-value for the interaction term is 0.024. How strong or convincing is that as evidence against the null hypothesis that there’s no association?\nIf you said you were “basically sure” or that there was “definitely NOT” evidence, maybe reconsider your phrasing and level of certainty? We rarely want to sound that sure. Also, consider the exact p-value and the strength of evidence it provides…\nAlso remember that in our course, we avoid the word ‘significant’ like it’s contaminated! Because…it kind of is, by decades of dubious stats teaching and practice reinforcing the idea that hypothesis testing yield ironclad yes-or-no results. Try the strength-of-evidence way outlined above, instead…",

    "text": "25.8 Selection: Practical Procedure\nOK, so the example above suggests by example that if your key predictor is interacting with another predictor in a model, and you are using ANOVA to help make inferences, the first thing to do is to look at the p-value for the interaction term.\nYes, that’s correct: first we look at the interaction p-value, which is at the BOTTOM of the ANOVA table!\nThat tells us whether there is evidence of an interaction or not. If yes, we are done: we can conclude the two interacting predictors interact, and thus they are both associated with the response. Ta-da!\nIf the p-value for the interaction term is large though, and we don’t have evidence of an interaction, then we can look also at the main effect p-value for our key predictor alone. That will tell us the answer to: OK, we don’t have evidence of an interaction, but is there an overall association of our key predictor with the response?\nSo for a model with interactions, to interpret ANOVA:\n\nFirst, check and interpret the p-value for the interaction term.\nIf there is evidence of an interaction, you’re done! That means you’ll conclude both interacting predictors are associated with the response (and they interact).\nIf there is not evidence of an interaction, then look at the main effect p-value for your predictor of interest to determine if there’s evidence it has an overall effect (though you already know there’s no evidence of the interaction, it might still have an overall consistent effect on the response).",

    "section": "25.9 Selection: IC",
    "text": "25.9 Selection: IC\nWhat if we wanted to make the same comparison – of models with and without the interaction – but using information criteria instead of hypothesis testing?\nWe’d use the same conceptual process as above: first compare the full model (with both predictors in, and interacting) with one where they are both included, but they don’t interact (replace the * with a + in the model formula). Then, if there is not evidence of interaction, we could also compare models with and without the key predictor to check for an overall effect. But now, instead of one Anova(full_model) call, we will need to fit each model and use AIC() to compare them.\nGive it a try…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nbee_int_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus * Food, data = bees)\nbee_no_int_model &lt;- ...\nAIC(...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nbee_int_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus * Food, data = bees)\nbee_no_int_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus + Food, data = bees)\nAIC(bee_int_model, bee_no_int_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on your results (using AIC), what do you conclude?\n\n Since the AIC score is negative (-154) for the model with the interaction and also for the one without, we have some doubts about the validity of the model overall. The AIC is about 4 units lower for the model with the interaction, so the model with the interaction fits a fair amount better and according to this analysis, there probably is an interaction There's most definitely an interaction Nope, most definitely NOT an interaction there! The AIC is about 4 units lower for the model with the interaction, so the model with the interaction doesn't fit as well, and according to this analysis, there probably is NOT an interaction\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for explanations of solution above.\n\nThe difference in AIC between the models is about 4, which is getting big enough that we think one model really does fit noticeably better than the other.\nSome points to remember:\n\nCarefully choose your level of certainty in presenting your results.\nLower AIC scores are better.\nThe answer focusing on the sign of the AIC value is basically nonsense in a sentence. Remember, for information criteria, it’s the relative value that matters - that is, the difference in IC values between models under comparison. The absolute AIC number for one model tells you…not much! Positive, negative, big, small…it’s only differences in IC values between models being compared that are informative for inference.\n\n\nAre the results the same with BIC? (not that you would normally do both – but just for practice, alter the code above to use BIC instead and then answer this question!) Since BIC enacts a different definition of “goodness” of model quality, the two will not necessarily always agree.\n\nCategorical-Quantitative Interaction\nWe can also interact a categorical and a quantitative variable. Then, what we essentially want is a different slope for the quantitative variable for each category.\nWe don’t have a quantitative variable in our dataset. I am adding a fake one ONLY to show how the code would work to fit a C-Q interaction model. You don’t need to be able to do this, of course…and in a real analysis it would be a TERRIBLE and dishonest idea! However, here for practice purposes only, we will do it.\n\n\n\nNow, fit a model with and effect of Virus and also a different slope for fake_qvar for each level of virus: one slope if there was no virus infection, and a different slope if there was viral infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nbee_model &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus * fake_qvar, data = bees)\n\n\n\n\nNow, since I made that fake_qvar data up totally at random, we expect that it shouldn’t really be associated with Mortality or interacting with Virus.\nCan you confirm that using either ANOVA or information criteria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution(s):\n\n\n\n\n\n# you would likely do one of these three:\ncar::Anova(bee_model)\nbee_model_noint &lt;- lm(Mortality ~ Virus + fake_qvar, data = bees)\nAIC(bee_model, bee_model_noint)\nBIC(bee_model, bee_model_noint)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuant-Quant Interaction\nOne more time, I’ll say:\nProbably just don’t go there. It’s quite hard to make sense of.\nA quantitative-quantitative interaction means that the slope for one predictor variable changes continuously as the value of the other predictor changes…in other words, the response depends on both predictors plus it depends on their product. Keep going for one example of this later on, though.\n\n\nGoing Further\nAny other models or comparisons you want to try?\nFeel free to experiment a bit if so…",

The code below takes each list of 30 residuals and computes its standard deviation (sd).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the actual likelihood\nFinally, we are ready to compute the natural log of the likelihood of the dataset, given each proposed model (each “proposed model” is one set of candidate \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\sigma\\)).\nFor each row, we need to compute the natural logarithm of the product of the likelihoods of all the residuals, in a normal distribution with mean 0 and sd \\(\\sigma\\). We will do the mathematical equivalent: find the sum of the natural logarithms of the normal likelihoods of each residual value.\nAnother explanation (add your own additional detail if needed):\n\nFor each single residual, we find its likelihood by finding the density of a normal (mean = 0, standard deviation = \\(\\sigma\\)) distribution for x = “our residual”\nWe take the natural log of each residual’s likelihood (working on a log scale reduces calculation problems for the computer)\nFor each row of MLE_grid – that is, for each proposed slope/intercept combination – we add up all the residual log-likelihoods to get one joint log-likelihood for the whole dataset\n\nBe patient, this will take a minute:",

    "text": "26.13 MLE, the Mathy Recap\nThis section is more or less option, but provides a bit more mathematical explanation and presentation for those interested.\n\nThe Likelihood Function\nWell, if we want to find the \\(\\beta\\)s that maximize the likelihood, we’re going to need a likelihood function!\nThey often involve PDFs, and the only one of those that is involved in the linear regression equation is the normal distribution that we assume the residuals to follow.\nWe said that\n\\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\epsilon\\]\nwith\n\\[\\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma)\\] Remember, the Normal probability density function is\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{\\frac{- (x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}\\] In our case, the random variable \\(x\\) being modeled is the residuals, whose mean \\(\\mu\\) is 0.\nAnd so the \\(i\\)th residual is\n\\[e_i = y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i\\]\nThe likelihood of the \\(i\\)th residual \\(e_i\\) is the normal density from the normal PDF with mean 0, and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). So it turns out that in order to estimate the \\(\\beta\\)s this way, we will also have to estimate \\(\\sigma\\), the residual standard error.\nThe joint likelihood of the whole dataset is just the product of the likelihoods of all the individual residuals (i.e., all the individual datapoints); so we have\n\\[L(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{\\frac{- (e_i - 0)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} = \\prod_{i = 1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{\\frac{- (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}\\]\nYour turn: take the natural logarithm of the expression above to get the log-likelihood. We’ll compare notes in the next section.\n\n\nLog-Likelihood Function\nThe log-likelihood function for simple linear regression (with just one predictor) is:\n\\[ \\ell(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} -log(\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2} log(2\\pi) - \\frac{(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\]\nIt is left as an exercise for you - if you are interested - to maximize the above expression using methods from calculus (find partial derivatives with respect to \\(beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), set equal to 0, and solve for the parameters). Or, it can also be done using linear algebra. You should find that the estimates are identical to the ones you would get using least squares estimation, and/or using lm().\n\nAn estimate for the residual standard error\nYou can also use calculus to find an estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) using the log-likelihood. First, try differentiating the full log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\sigma\\) – again we’ll compare notes in the next section.\n\n\nWhat’s your derivative?\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial{\\ell}}{\\partial{\\sigma}} = \\frac{-n}{\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma^3} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2  \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{-1}{\\sigma^3} \\bigg{(} n\\sigma^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2 \\bigg{)} = \\frac{-1}{\\sigma^3} \\bigg{(} n\\sigma^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2\\bigg{)}\\]\nSetting this equal to 0, we immediately know that the \\(\\frac{-1}{\\sigma^3}\\) can not be 0, giving\n\\[0 = n\\sigma^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2\\]\n\\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum e_i^2}{n}\\]\nWhich seems very sensible – the mean of the sum of squared residuals estimates the variance.\nUnfortunately (as so often happens) this estimator is biased; an unbiased version that is more often used is:\n\\[ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum e_i^2}{(n - 2)}\\]",

Really, click the link to check out an overwhelming schematic.\nEach probability distribution is a function that matches possible values of a variable (usually depicted on the x-axis) with a measure of how often they occur (usually shown on the y-axis).\n\nDiscrete & Continuous Distributions\nWe can classify probability distributions into the categories of discrete and continuous distributions.\n\nDiscrete distributions model variable that can take on a discrete set of values (for example, the number of successes in n trials, or the number of birds spotted in the forest). For these, the function values are a set of probabilities that sum to 1.\nContinuous distributions model variables that can take on any numeric value within a specified range (for example, proportion between 0 and 1, or height of people in cm). For these, the function values are in “density” or “likelihood” units – they are scaled such that the total area under the functions’ curve is 1.\n\n\n\nSupport\nThe support of a distribution describes the range of values a variable can have (it might be 0-1, 0-\\(\\infty\\), \\(-\\infty\\) - \\(\\infty\\), or (for the Uniform!) values between some specified minimum and maximum).\nKnowing all this, you can choose a distribution that is a good fit for a variable by matching its type and support.",

Cranmer, Estifanos Debasu, & Adam C. Levine (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198235).\nThe authors state,\n\n\nThe 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols…The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.\n\n\nWe might be able to confirm some of their findings.\nVariables in the dataset include:\n\nMedStaffHRZ, High risk zone staff entries by medical staff\nWASHStaffHRZ, High risk zone staff entries by WASH staff (for cleaning, etc.)\nTotalStaffHRZ1, Total number of staff entries to high risk zone\nPatient Occupancy (number of people being treated)\nTreatment Center Location\nFreshWater amount used\nTotalWater amount used\nNumber of CoverallsUsed (Coveralls are body suits used to prevent infection)\nAmount of PPEDamaged (PPE is personal protective equipment like masks, gowns)\nAmount of HighChlorine disinfectant used\nAmount of LowChlorine disinfectant used\nAmount of ScrubsLaundered\n\nNote that since not all variables were recorded at all locations at all times, there are many missing values in this dataset. Also, you’re advised to ignore (not use) any other variables not included in the list above.\n\nResearch Question\nIs there an association between the number of N95 masks used and the number of patients being treated in the facility?\n\n\nData Access\nYou can find this data at: https://sldr.netlify.app/data/ebola-WASH.csv\n\nwash_data &lt;- read_csv('https://sldr.netlify.app/data/ebola-WASH.csv',\n                      show_col_types = FALSE)\nglimpse(wash_data)\n\n\n\nCausal Diagram\nTake a moment to sketch a causal diagram for this situation.\nI did…and I’d argue that to answer our research question, with the number of N95 masks (N95Used) as the response variable and number of patients (Occupancy) as the key predictor of interest, the only other predictor it makes sense to include in our model is the number of medical staff entering the high-risk zone (MedStaffHRZ).\nAfter making your own diagram, do you agree? If not, what would you do instead?\n\n\nDiagram notes\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Occupancy] --&gt; B(N95Used)\n  C[MedStaffHRZ] --&gt; B\n  C --&gt; D[PPEDamaged]\n  A --&gt; E[Items Used]\n  A --&gt; F[PPEDamaged]\n  A --&gt; G[Water Use]\n  C --&gt; E\n  C --&gt; F\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my diagram, the number of med staff entering the HRZ affects the number of masks used directly and also via the number of items of PPE damaged. Patient occupancy affects the number of N95s directly, too.\nOther than that, occupancy affects the number of other items used or washed or damaged, and also the amount of water (of all kinds) used. The number of med staff present also affects the number of various items used/washed/damaged. Location might complicate matters, but we only actually have data on N95 masks used from one location of the two studied. So I can’t identify any confounders or other variables that must be included to model what we would like to model.",

    "text": "27.9 Problem: Overdispersion\nWe will actually not really continue using Poisson regression. Wait! Why not?\nIt turns out that the mean = variance condition of Poisson regression is pretty restrictive, and rarely met in practice. Most often, the residuals are actually overdispersed: the variance is greater than the mean by some amount.\nCases are super rare where it’s not worth estimating just one extra parameter to account for this (if it’s there…which it nearly always is).\nI’m suggesting there’s some variation on a Poisson regression - another count regression model that does account for overdispersion.\nThere is! It’s called Negative Binomial regression (you got it – it uses the Negative Binomial distribution instead of the Poisson, but is otherwise very similar). Some people use quasi-Poisson regression for the same purpose, but our go-to model for any dataset where our response variable is count data will always be the negative binomial model. This allows us to continue fitting models via maximum-likelihood estimation, without resorting to the quasi-likelihood approach the quasi-Poisson model has to empoy.",

    "text": "28.5 Prediction Plots\nOnce you have fitted a count regression model, how do you interpret it?\nWhen we went to great lengths to make prediction plots for a linear regression model so we could “see” the slope of the predicted relationship, you may have wondered: why bother? I can just look at the slope estimate and get the same insight from that one number, since I know that if the predictor increases by one unit, then the expected response value changes by slope units…\nNow, with a more complicated model equation with a link function, it’s not so easy at all to interpret the model summary or model equation directly. In this situtation, we will really appreciate those prediction plots…\nThe easiest way to understand the effects of different predictors of a count regression is to look at plots of model predictions.\nHowever, as always we don’t want to overlay model predictions on a predictor-vs-response data scatterplot; in a model with more than one predictor, since predictors other than the one we are interested in will influence the predictions, introducing extra variation. Instead, we will make prediction plots again – we’ll construct a new (fake) dataset to make predictions for, in which all predictors but the one we are interested in are held constant.\nWe can use the predict_response() function to produce prediction plots as usual. Below is one for the WASH model and Occupancy; run it to see the prediction plot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture also confirms what we learn from the model selection: The expected number of N95s used does clearly seem to depend on patient occupancy. (Remember, the shaded area tells us a plausible zone where the true line might fall, and the shaded zone in the Occupancy prediction plot definitely could not accommodate a line with 0 slope!) But it also tells us clearly, visually, how Occupancy and N95s used are associated: it would be hard to do the same with just the model summary table, but with this plot we see right away that if the occupancy goes up from 4 to 12 patients the number of masks expected to be used goes up from about 27 to about 37. So, these plots help us show what the model is telling us and provide a nice complement to (but not a replacement for!) visualizations of the actual data.\nNow…go back above and alter the code to make another prediction plot for MedStaffHRZ, please. What do you learn from that one?",

We might want to know how many animals were seen per hour or per km the survey boat travelled…seeing 100 animals per day (if you worked for one hour of the day) is very different from seeing 100 per day (if you worked 12.5 hours)!\nBird counts. Similar rational as for the dolphins.\nSchool survey on crime example from last module. We previously thought to include the school size as a regular predictor of the number of thefts occurring in the school per year. But we could also think of modeling the number of thefts per school year, per school, per enrolled student.\n\nIn this case, it would be natural to adjust for “effort” because rows of the dataset contain counts per…something and the quantity of the something varies row to row.",

Instead, you have to choose which response variable you really want to model – is it the total count (no offset), or the count-per-something (with offset)?\n\nDredge side-note\nNote: We mostly don’t use dredge()! But…if you use dredge() with a model with an offset, be sure to specify the offset as a “fixed” term, i.e. a term that must be included in all models:\n\ndredge(offset_mod, fixed = 'offset(log(effort))')\n\n\n\nHow Do I Decide?\nYou have to decide whether the response variable that you most want to model is the original counts, or the counts per…something, that is, adjusted for the amount of effort (in some sense) expended to obtain those counts.\nSometimes it’s not really clear: would it make more sense to model the number of N95 masks used per med-staff person in the HRZ using an offset, or to use MedStaffHRZ as a “regular” predictor? Using MedStaffHRZ as a “regular” predictor rather than an offset allows for the possibility that the response (number of masks used) depends on MedStaffHRZ, but doesn’t specify exactly what slope (on the link scale) this relationship must have. With an offset, you are effectively requiring a very specific mathematical relationship between the offset variable and the response, in which you are literally modeling the counts divided by the offset variable value. This assumes that if the offset variable goes up by a certain amount, the count will go up proportionally.\nSo in some cases, you clearly, definitely need an offset. For example, the dolphin survey example from earlier – you definitely want to model the number of dolphins seen per distance and time searched, not the number seen per boat trip regardless of how much area was searched or how long the excursion was.\nIn other cases, you will have to make a judgment call, in which case the “regular predictor” option might allow for more flexibility in the proposed relationship between the response and the offset variable.",

We called this the \\(\\frac{n}{15}\\) rule – take the number of rows in your dataset (\\(n\\)), divide by 15, and that’s about how many parameters you can expect to reliably estimate when fitting a regression model to that dataset.\nFor binary data, it’s a bit different. Imagine you had 10,000 rows of data and your response variable was the number of people who had eyes of two different colors. If you data matched the US population, you might expect to have about 67 “successes” – people with 2 different colored eyes. At first 10,000 seems like a huge sample, but counting the successes makes you realize you might not actually be able to estimate even the proportion with this trait – much less how it depends on lots of predictors – with your \\(n = 10000\\) dataset.\nWe have a different sample-size rule of thumb for binary data: call it \\(\\frac{m}{15}\\)…\nFirst, count the number of successes and the number of failures in your dataset (for the example above, it would be 67 and 9933). Take the smaller of the two numbers; call that \\(m\\). Divide by 15 to get a rough estimate of the number of parameter you’d be able to estimate well in a regression model fit to that data.",

Multiple studies have linked amphibian abnormalities to chemically contaminated areas, but inference about causal mechanisms is lacking. Here we use a high incidence of abnormalities in Alaskan wood frogs to strengthen inference about the mechanism for these abnormalities. We suggest that limb abnormalities are caused by a combination of multiple stressors. Specifically, toxicants lead to increased predation, resulting in more injuries to developing limbs and subsequent developmental malformations. We evaluated a variety of putative causes of frog abnormalities at 21 wetlands on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, south-central Alaska, USA, between 2004 and 2006. Variables investigated were organic and inorganic contaminants, parasite infection, abundance of predatory invertebrates, UVB, and temperature. Logistic regression and model comparison using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) identified dragonflies and both organic and inorganic contaminants as predictors of the frequency of skeletal abnormalities. We suggest that both predators and contaminants alter ecosystem dynamics to increase the frequency of amphibian abnormalities in contaminated habitat. Future experiments should test the causal mechanisms by which toxicants and predators may interact to cause amphibian limb abnormalities. - Reeves et al. 2010, https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0879.1",

    "section": "29.7 Model Equation",
    "text": "29.7 Model Equation\nHow will our regression model equation work for binary response variables? First, let’s recap the other response variable types we’ve seen so far.\n\nLinear Regression\nRecall, for linear regression we fitted a model for continuous (numeric) response variable \\(y\\) according to:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + ...\\beta_k x_k + \\epsilon \\]\nwhere \\(x\\)s are the \\(k\\) predictor variables, \\(\\beta\\)s are the parameters to be estimated by the model, and \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma)\\) are the model residuals.\n\n\nCount Regression\nWhen our response variable was a count variable, we modified our equation to:\n\\[log(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i} + \\beta_3 x_{3i} + ...\\beta_k x_{ki}\\]\npositing that \\(y_i \\sim Pois(\\lambda_i)\\) for Poisson regression; similarly for quasi-Poisson or negative binomial regression, we just replaced that Poisson distribution with a negative binomial distribution, \\(y_i \\sim NBinom(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i)\\).\nAnd of course, there are still residuals, defined as \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\)…\n\n\nBinary Regression\nWhat if our response variable is logical, also known as binary, like it is now – a categorical variable with just two possible values? We will designate one of the two values a “success,” and then we want to predict the probability of success as a function of some set of predictors. What will our model equation look like in this case?\nFirst, we’ll need to think about what probability distribution might come into play to model a binary variable. The obvious choice is the binomial distribution, which models the observed number of “successes” as a function of the number of “trials” and the probability of success, \\(p\\), in each trial. Specifically, it says that the probability of observing \\(k\\) successes in \\(n\\) trials will be given by:\n\\[P(X = k) = p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}\\]\nWe can use this, in much the same way we used the Poisson distribution and the negative binomial with count data! Again we need to adjust our model equation…\nWe CANNOT write\n\\[\\text{skeletal_abnormality} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{dragonfly_relative_density} + ... \\]\nthe left-hand-side there, skeletal_abnormality, is a categorical variable so there’s just NO way it can “equal” a real number.\nBut hey, check out the parameters of the binomial distribution – specifically, \\(p\\). That’s the probability of “success”, or in our example, it could be the probability of having a skeletal abnormality. We could say\n\\[\\text{skeletal_abnormality}_i \\sim Binom(n=1, p_i)\\]\nIn other words, our categorical, binary response follows a binomial distribution with some probability of success \\(p_i\\) for each case \\(i\\), and those \\(p_i\\) will depend on our predictors. That actually makes sense!\nBut…we STILL can’t write\n\\[p_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + ...\\beta_k x_k\\]\nBecause \\(p_i\\) is bounded between 0 and 1 and the right hand side of the equation is…not, at all.\nWe need a link function that takes values between 0 and 1 as input, and maps them to values along the real numberline. One such superhero function is the logit function, defined as \\(logit(p) = log(\\frac{p}{(1-p)})\\). This function maps probabilities to positive and negative real numbers, effectively “spreading them out” from the range 0-1 to the full range of real numbers.\nSo our binary regression equation is…\n\\[ logit(p_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + ...\\beta_k x_k\\]\nHow does this equation relate back to our desired response variable again?\nWell, the \\(i\\)th observation of the response variable is assumed to follow a binomial distribution with probability \\(p_i\\) of “success” (\\(y_i \\sim Binom(n_i, p_i)\\)).\n\\(n_i\\) depends on the setup of the data and doesn’t need estimating – often n = 1 for every row of the dataset, as here where the response is a two-valued categorical variable and each row is one frog. We can think of each frog as the subject of one binomial trial, with success/failure meaning abnormality/lack of abnormality of the frog.\n(And there are still residuals, which are the difference between the observed and expected response, \\(e_i = I_{success} = p_i\\), where \\(I_{success}\\) is 0 if the \\(i\\)th data point is a “failure” and 1 if “success.”)",

    "text": "29.11 Assessment: Conditions\nUnder what conditions is a logistic regression model appropriate?\n\nResponse variable is logical – you can characterize it as the outcome of a binomial trial (or a set of independent binomial trials).\n\nSome response variables can be expressed as proportions, but can not be well modelled with binomial regression. For example, you might take one-minute recordings in the woods and measure the proportion of each minute during which bird song was audible. The data will look like proportions, but you can’t think of them as binomial trials and should not model them with binomial regression (what is a “trial” here, and what is a “success”? Make sure you can answer those questions before using binomial regression!)\n\nLinearity: logit(p) should have a linear relationship with each predictor variable. (A bit hard to check predictor-by-predictor - you’d need to group observations some smart way, compute probabilities of succes in each group, and plot the logit() of that as a function of each predictor. We will generally rely on the scaled residual plot to detect issues with this condition, instead.)\nIndependence of residuals: Same as usual.\nMean-variance relationship: The Pearson or Deviance residuals will decrease as a function of fitted value, and should have approximately constant variance as a function of fitted value. But a basic residuals vs. fitted plot is of almost no use to us (almost always looks odd to the untrained eye in the same way; very hard to interpret). So we will use our scaled residual plot again for sure! Its derivation and interpretation is the same as it was in count regression!\nNO distributional assumptions about residuals to check.",

So if P(success) = 0.75, then the odds will be \\(\\frac{0.75}{0.25}\\) = 3 or “three to one” – you will usually succeed three times for every failure.\nRemember, the logit function was \\(logit(x) = log(\\frac{p}{1-p})\\)?\nIn other words, the logit is the log of the odds ratio.\nThis means that the coefficients (the \\(\\beta\\)s!) of a binary regression model with logit link function have special interpretations in terms of odds ratios.\nRemember our model:\n\n\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula:          \nskeletal_abnormality ~ detectable_analytes + dragonfly_relative_density +  \n    other_invert_relative_density\nData: frogs\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   1382.8    1406.8    -687.4    1374.8      2918 \n\n\nConditional model:\n                                Estimate Std.

See you on the next page after you do it…\n\nModel equation\n\\[ logit(p_i) = -2.8 - 0.0033\\text{detectable_analytes} + 0.0052\\text{dragonfly_relative_density}\\] \\[- 0.000034\\text{other_invert_relative_density}\\] Where \\(p_i\\) is the probability of a frog’s having a skeletal abnormality. This probability is different depending on the conditions (contamination level, predation pressure, etc.).\nAccording to this model, the log-odds (logit(p)) for a frog with zero detected analytes and zero invertebrate predators (dragonflies or others) present would be on average -2.8, so the odds of having a skeletal_abnormality for such a frog are \\(e^{-2.8} = 0.061\\).\nThat would be a kind of lucky frog, though! The median frog can expect to have a relative dragonfly density of about 20. If it still had zero other-invert predators, and no detected analytes, its expected logit(p) would be…I mean…you compute what it would be using the equation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nlogit_p &lt;- -2.8 - 0.0033 * detectable_analytes + 0.0052 * dragonfly_relative_density -\n  0.000034 * other_invert_relative_density \nAbove, the model parameter estimates are filled in – now, what are the predictor variable values? Fill in those too…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nlogit_p &lt;- -2.8 - 0 + 0.0052 * 20 -\n  0.000034 * 0\nlogit_p\n\n\n\n\nThe log-odds for the median-dragonflies, no-contaminants, no-other-invert-predator frog are -2.7, so the odds of it having a skeletal_abnormality are \\(e^{-2.7} = 0.067\\) – a bit higher than the other lucky frog.\nNotice – there’s another way of thinking about this, too.\nLet \\(\\beta_{dragon}\\) be the estimated parameter value for the dragonfly relative density slope, \\(\\beta_{dragon} = 0.0052\\). If the relative_dragonfly_density increases by 1, then the \\(logit(p) = log(\\frac{p}{(1-p)})\\) will increase by 0.0052.\nThink about exponentiating both sides of the model equation – then instead of the log of the odds, we have the odds on the left hand side; and on the right?\n\n\nModel equation on odds scale\n\\[ \\frac{p}{(1-p)} = e^{-2.8 - 0.0033\\text{detectable_analytes} + 0.0052\\text{dragonfly_relative_density}- 0.000034\\text{other_invert_relative_density}}\\] By the laws of logarithms, \\(e^{a+b} = e^ae^b\\) so we can rewrite that as:\n\\[\\frac{p}{(1-p)}  = e^{-2.8}e^{- 0.0033\\text{detectable_analytes}}e^{0.0052\\text{dragonfly_relative_density}} e^{- 0.000034\\text{other_invert_relative_density}}\\]\nand again by the laws of logarithms, \\(e^{ab} = (e^a)^b\\) so it’s\n\\[\\frac{p}{(1-p)}  = e^{-2.8}(e^{- 0.0033})^{\\text{detectable_analytes}} (e^{0.0052})^{\\text{dragonfly_relative_density}} (e^{- 0.000034})^{\\text{other_invert_relative_density}}\\]\nSo, \\(e^{\\beta_{dragon}} = 0.0052\\) is the multiplier on the odds ratio – every time the relative dragonfly density goes up by 1 unit, the odds of abnormality are multiplied by \\(e^{\\beta_{dragon}} = e^{0.0052} = 1.005214\\).\nAnd in general, \\(e^{\\beta}\\) is the multiplier on the odds ratio for a one-unit change in the predictor variable for which \\(\\beta\\) is the model coefficient.\n(Some folks are really into reporting model results from logistic regression - that is, regression for a binary outcome with a logit link – using these “odds ratio multipliers.” However, we will prefer to just look at, and present, prediction plots on the “natural” probability scale; odd and log-odds and odds ratio multipliers are hard for many to understand…)",

(Since the Pearson residuals are already adjusted for the expected variance, we should see approximately constant spread, with values ranging from about -2 to 2 (and not more than a few larger than \\(\\pm\\) 3.))\nHowever, we can also continue to use our scaled residual plot, interpreting it as we have for count and binary one-trial-per-row data…\n\nduck_sim &lt;- simulateResiduals(duck_logit_model2)\nplotResiduals(duck_sim, quantreg = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?

The values of impact are 0 (for none) and 1 (for impact is present). (We could have treated impact as officially categorical, although the mathematical result is equivalent.)\nSo, we think maybe when impact is present the chances of seeing ducks go down.\nBy how much, we’d have to use odds ratios or think quite hard…OR just make a quick prediction plot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaah, now we see the value of these plots better!\nBu we also see the downside of lazily not forcing impact to be categorical.\nAll numerical results will be the same if we change it, but we’ll get a more interpretable plot that doesn’t suggest that impact can actually vary continuously between 0 and 1.\n(We could also plot the predict_response()) output by hand to do this, but it’s probably easier/less code to simply update the model.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(It could look even better if instead of using factor() on the fly we changed the original dataset at the start to make impact a categorical variable, maybe even with informative values instead of numeric coding…but that is left as an exercise for you!)\nNow that we have the prediction plot, we can conclude that impact is associated with the probability of duck presence; the evidence we have in our dataset says that we’d expect the probability of ducks being present to go down by about 1.5% in the presence of impact.\nSo, a difference that is pretty consistent and detectable, but small in absolute terms: instead of being seen 91.5 or so percent of the time, they will be seen about 90% of the time. If we wanted to emphasize that, we might even show our prediction plot with a y axis extending from 0-100%:\n\npredict_response(duck_logit_model2b, 'impact') |&gt;\n  plot() |&gt;\n  gf_labs(title = '',\n          y = 'Probability of Duck Presence') |&gt;\n  gf_lims(y = c(0,1))\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYikes - we lost some of the pretty y axis formatting as percentages, and the error bars are still there but invisible because we’ve zoomed out so far! So, still some work to be done, but food for thought in terms of how to present results. Can you make the plot even better? I did the “percents” thing for you, but what else would you alter? Give it a try…",

    "text": "30.12 Summary\nWe’ve now seen examples of fitting a binary regression model to data with “one trial per row” or “multiple trials per row” – those terms are just something invented for our course, but they do describe the two common data setups that are possible for binary data.\nWhy do we need both?\nWell, if you use data already collected by someone else, sometimes it will come to you in one format, and sometimes the other.\nIf you know basic data wrangling, it’s not hard to switch between them.\nBut you may want to keep the data in the format it comes in! Data fitted to the same dataset in one-trial-per-row format and multiple-trials-per-row format will yield the exact same parameter estimates. But model selection results will not always be identical, due to nuances in the way that sample size is determined in each case.\nIf someone set up the data with multiple trials per row, often that means that they think of all the trials in a row as a unit or group of some kind, and so it might make sense to respect that.\nAnother key take-away from this module is that if binary data is in a multiple-trials-per-row setup, you can easily mistake it for count data! You’ll notice a column associated with the response variable that has non-negative integer values in it and think, “count data”! But it isn’t!\nHow can you tell which is which and not be fooled?\nIn multiple trials per row binary data, there is a known, definite number of trials. That is, you always know the maximum number of “successes” (that is, the max variable value) for a given row. For example, if you watched 14 sites and marked whether ducks were sighted at each one, you might have “success” in spotting ducks at up to 14 of them and never more.\nIn true count data, there is no “ceiling” to the total counts that might be observed. If you are counting how many ducks you see in an hour, it might be really unlikely, but theoretically you could see any huge number of ducks. There is no set number of “trials” in which you could succeed in seeing ducks (or not); you just count as many as you see with no upper limit.\nGenerally, if you fit a count regression to binary data or a binary regression to count data, there will be problems with model assessment. So, look carefully to make sure what type of response variable you really have, and choose a model to match!",

    "text": "31.5 Data for Example\nSome state wildlife biologists want to model how many fish are being caught by people fishing at a state park. Visitors are asked how long they stayed, how many people were in the group, were there children in the group and how many fish were caught. Some visitors do not fish, but there is (alas) no data on whether a person fished or not. Some visitors who did fish did not catch any fish. There are a lot of zero counts of “fish caught” in the data because of both the people that did not fish, and those who failed to catch anything.\nWe have data on 250 groups that went to a park. Each group was questioned about how many fish they caught (count), how many children were in the group (child), how many people were in the group (persons), and whether or not they brought a camper to the park (camper). There are also variables xb and zg which are an utter mystery (I have no idea what they are measuring and no access to further documentation… sorry!).\nIn addition to predicting the number of fish caught, there is interest in predicting the existence of excess zeros, i.e., the probability that a group caught zero fish. We will use the variables child, persons, and camper in our model.\nLet’s look at the data and do a little bit of wrangling to make categorical variables clearly categorical (instead of coded numerically) and to make categorical versions of some count variables (like the number of children).\n\nfishing_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/fish.csv\")\nglimpse(fishing_data)\n\nRows: 250\nColumns: 8\n$ nofish   &lt;int&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0…\n$ livebait &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ camper   &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0…\n$ persons  &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4…\n$ child    &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1…\n$ xb       &lt;dbl&gt; -0.89631456, -0.55834496, -0.40173101, -0.95629811, 0.4368909…\n$ zg       &lt;dbl&gt; 3.050404787, 1.746148944, 0.279938877, -0.601525664, 0.527709…\n$ count    &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1…\n\nfishing_data &lt;- fishing_data |&gt; mutate(\n  nofish = factor(nofish),\n  livebait=factor(livebait),\n  livebait = ifelse(livebait == 0, 'No', 'Yes'),\n  camper=factor(camper),\n  camper = ifelse(camper == 0, 'No', 'Yes'),\n  child_cat = factor(child))\nglimpse(fishing_data)\n\nRows: 250\nColumns: 9\n$ nofish    &lt;fct&gt; 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ livebait  &lt;chr&gt; \"No\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"No\",…\n$ camper    &lt;chr&gt; \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"Y…\n$ persons   &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, …\n$ child     &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, …\n$ xb        &lt;dbl&gt; -0.89631456, -0.55834496, -0.40173101, -0.95629811, 0.436890…\n$ zg        &lt;dbl&gt; 3.050404787, 1.746148944, 0.279938877, -0.601525664, 0.52770…\n$ count     &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, …\n$ child_cat &lt;fct&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, …",

(If you have a fun one, email it to your prof for a touch of extra credit!)\n\nNumber of cigarettes smoked per day; people who never smoke are true zeros (similarly, number of cups of coffee drunk per day, etc.)\nNumber of babies birthed; people who don’t have a uterus are true zeros\nNumber of courses taken per semester; people not enrolled in a school are true zeros\n\n(For each of these, you might ask: Why use a fancy model to separate true zeros like this? Why not just collect data on whether a person is a true zero by, for example, asking a survey question like “Do you ever smoke?” Before asking “How many per day?” That’s a very smart question.

Cool.\nYou might ask if it would make sense to fit the two models separately. There is a class of models that does this - they are called “hurdle models.” First, they model the probability of being “not zero” with a binary model. But then, the resulting count model has to use a special version of the Poisson or NB distribution that is zero-truncated (because the zero counts are already excluded). A nice bit about doing it the zero-inflation way is that it’s possible to estimate which (or at least which proportion) of the data zero counts are “true” zeros vs. observed zeros.",

To decide, you have to make a model plan to answer the question: “What predictors would influence the chances of a group being a ‘true zero’ and being at the park not to fish?”\nThe main count model, on the other hand, should include predictors that would influence the number of fish that would be caught by groups who had come to to park to fish.\n\nTweedie Model\nThis is a fun side note…\nAnother option for this type of data might be to try a Tweedie model, because it also allows for a probability mass at 0 (in other words, allows for zero inflation).\nThe Tweedie distributions we are considering are not exactly perfect for count data since the positive part of the distribution is like a gamma distribution (continuous, not counts), but the shape and support of the distribution are pretty close to our data.\nLet’s try:",

    "text": "31.12 Model Selection\nOne thing to understand is: is the ZIP model a better fit to the data than just a Poisson model? We can think of ZI as a different way of modelling overdispersion, an alternative to NB or quasi-Poisson models when we know there are true zeros in the data set.\nTo be able to run the AIC() code below, you will need to fit 3 new models: POIS, NB1, and NB2, which are the same as your ZIP, ZINB1, and ZINB2 except that the don’t have any zero-inflation…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\nJust remove the ziformula input from the models we fit earlier in this tutorial.\nPOIS &lt;- glmmTMB(count ~ camper + child + persons, \n                data = fishing_data,\n                family = poisson(link = 'log'))\nNB1 &lt;- glmmTMB(count ~ camper + child + persons, \n               data = fishing_data,\n              family = nbinom1(link = 'log'))\nNB2 &lt;- glmmTMB(count ~ camper + child + persons, \n               data = fishing_data,\n              family = nbinom2(link = 'log'))\nAIC(ZIP, POIS, NB1, NB2)\n\n\n\n\nWell, yes, the ZIP model is much better than the Poisson!

(Go ahead and try it above…)\nThe improvement in goodness of fit with the zero-inflation is not really enough to make us prefer these ZI models to simpler models that also allow overdispersion, like the NB models.

    "text": "31.13 NB vs ZI?\nThe NB models and the ZI models (with whatever “family” you choose) are two different ways of dealing with overdispersion caused by an abundance of zeros in the data. I’d recommend choosing ZI models only if:\n\nThere are true zeros and other zeros in your data, and you want to model this explicitly; or if\nThe ZI models fit the data much better than a simpler non-ZI NB (or perhaps Tweedie) model.\n\nFor our dataset, the zero-inflated negative binomial models seem to be best, among the ZI models. However, there is still a lot more work and thinking that could be done here! That is part of the reason this is a supplemental topic – the model planning and interpretation can get very complex and thinking through the context of your problem with expert help is pretty crucial since there are so many options in play. For example…\n\nZero inflation covariates\nWhat if the Logistic regression part of the model also depends on covariates? That seems reasonable – maybe the number of people present, whether they are camping, and the number of kids present would help you to predict whether a group was going to go fishing at all.\nTo check that, we would need to change the ziformula. It is possible this change might make the ZI models competitive with, or better than, the non-ZI NB models in IC terms.\nBut then, we’d need to check some version of the \\(\\frac{m}{15}\\) rule to make sure we have enough data to estimate all the needed parameters…and that’s not totally straightforward, since we are not sure which are true zeros.\n\n\nInteraction terms\nFor this dataset, it may also make sense to consider some more predictors, and interaction terms. For example, maybe live bait use is a good predictor, and maybe the relationship between live bait use and number of fish caught changes depending on the number of children present.\nFor example, we might try something like:\n\nZINB1b &lt;- glmmTMB(count ~ camper + child*livebait + persons, \n                  ziformula= ~1, \n                  data = fishing_data, family = nbinom1(link = 'log'))\nsummary(ZINB1b)\n\n Family: nbinom1  ( log )\nFormula:          count ~ camper + child * livebait + persons\nZero inflation:         ~1\nData: fishing_data\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n    818.0     846.2    -401.0     802.0       242 \n\n\nDispersion parameter for nbinom1 family (): 8.47 \n\nConditional model:\n                   Estimate Std.

But do you think the improvement is because of the interaction term?\nLooking at the p-values, we might suspect that while livebait helps predict fish caught, there isn’t a clear interaction between effects of live bait use and the number of kids present.\nIn this case, it is hard to fathom all the model selection options because there can be predictors (and interactions) in both parts of the model.\nStarting with a causal diagram with separate ‘bubbles’ for true zeroes as well as for expected counts for non-true-zeros will help organize your thinking! Consider also the size of the dataset - combining the count-data (n/15) and binary data (m/15) rules of thumb.\n\n\nInteraction Note!\nHowever you plan your model (and do selection on it), one thing to remember is: You can never include an interaction term in a model without also including the corresponding “main effect” term. For example, you can not have an interaction between child and livebait without also having both child and livebait as individual predictors in the model. (In fact, I have intentionally not taught you how to fit the “wrong” model…as long as you use the * to specify an interaction in your model formula, you should be fine! Do not use : in your R model formulas or you may run into trouble!)",

Here, they will help us clarify what “success” is in the logistic regression part of the model – according to the help file for the zeroinfl() function, and for glmmTMB() too, we should be able to see that a “success” is to be a “true zero”.\nLet’s try an example - making prediction plots for our ZINB2 model for different numbers of persons in the group. (This wasn’t the best fitting option but was the best of the ZI models we tried…)\nBefore showing the plot, we can omit the |&gt; plot() part to figure out at what values the “other predictors not shown” have been held fixed. That’s important to state in your interpretation of any prediction plot…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here, predictions are “adjusted for” (aka “holding constant at”) 0 children and “Yes” camper.\nNow, the graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of fish caught goes up as the number of people in the group goes up.\nBut how is the plot above dealing with the zero-inflation part of the model?\nIn fact…it’s not. This is just showing the “count” part of the model. That’s the default.\nBut we can add the input type = 'zi_prob to instead “see” the zero-inflation part of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this make sense?!? Looks strange…\nBut, yes, it does. This is a prediction plot to show how the probability of being-at-the-park-to-NOT-fish depends on group size (persons).\nBut in our model, the ZI part of the model had no predictors, so we said that probability didn’t actually depend at all on persons! So, the flat line makes sense.\nThe model is further telling us that (despite VERY high uncertainty) our best guess is that the probability of a true zero is very small.",

Notice also that any continuous quantity that has both upper and lower bounds on its possible values can be transformed to be between 0-1 – some examples of that are on the list below, too.\nHere are a few examples:\n\nScores on an exam, measured as a proportion between 0-1\nBatting averages of baseball players\nInterest rates\nRank of individual contestants on Survivor, measured as a quantile (if you were best on your season, your rank would be 1, and if you were worst, then 0)\nHours of sleep per 24 hours, computed as \\(\\frac{(\\text{hours slept})}{24}\\)\nProportion of each hour during which dolphin sounds were audible on an underwater sound recording\nBridge condition ratings, determined according to US government standards and ranging from 0-9 (so they can be converted to 0-1 bounded data by dividing by 9)\nProportion of time a mouse spent floating (rather than actively swimming) during a “forced swim test”\n\nSo…this kind of data is more common than you might think!

The description here is a very simplified one (so check out the paper if you want more detail).\n\nResearch Questions\nThe work in the paper sought to understand how human cells become infected with HIV: when exposed to the virus, what conditions make cells more/less susceptible, and what types of cells are more/less likely to become infected?\n\n\nSample Collection\nThe authors recruited healthy volunteers to donate blood samples, from which different types of cells were isolated and then grown in the lab.\n\n\nExperiments\nThe cells (in varying conditions) were exposed to modified versions of the HIV virus – the parts of the virus that facilitate infection were intact, but not the disease-causing parts; and a GFP (green fluorescent protein) gene was added so that infected cells would glow. Some exposed cells become infected, and some do not. What proportion get infected? Well, it depends on the conditions (and other things, such as the donor and more).\nTo measure the rate of infection for each type of cell and condition, a device called a flow cytometer was used (which can detect the GFP-expressing glowing cells).\nThe resulting data includes the percent GFP-positive cells detected in each sample (but not the total number of cells that went through the machine).\n\n\nThe Actual Data\nHere’s a glimpse() of the dataset, called hiv_memory_naive:\n\nglimpse(hiv_memory_naive)\n\nRows: 54\nColumns: 5\n$ Donor       &lt;chr&gt; \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D13\", \"D…\n$ CellType    &lt;fct&gt; Resting, Resting, Resting, IEC-, IEC-, IEC-, IEC+, IEC+, I…\n$ MorN        &lt;chr&gt; \"Memory\", \"Memory\", \"Memory\", \"Memory\", \"Memory\", \"Memory\"…\n$ InfRates    &lt;dbl&gt; 1.3582343, 1.5347334, 1.0518934, 12.5454545, 9.1435185, 7.…\n$ InfRateProp &lt;dbl&gt; 0.013582343, 0.015347335, 0.010518934, 0.125454546, 0.0914…\n\n\nVariables in the data include:\n\nDonor ID of the person who provided the sample\nCellType, which may be:\n\n“Resting,” the cells were cultured alone, without human intestinal endothelial cells\n“IEC-,” the cells were cultured along with human intestinal endothelial cells (IEC), but without interferon \\(\\gamma\\)\n“IEC+,” the cells were cultured along with IEC, and also with interferon \\(\\gamma\\)\n\nMorN, whether the cells were:\n\n“Memory” T cells, immune cells that are primed to respond more to certain infections\n“Naive” T cells, immune cells that help the body fight infect by new/unfamiliar infections\n\nInfRates: The HIV infection rate (= GFP glow rate) as a percentage\nInfRateProp: The HIV infection rate (= GFP glow rate) as a proportion\n\nWe want to model the differences in HIV infection rate by cell type and memory vs naive cells, while controlling for differences between donors.\nHow do the data look?

Memory cells have higher infection rates than Naive cells. Compared to lone “Resting” cells, those cultures along with IEC (intestinal endothelial cells) were infected much more, and adding interferon \\(\\gamma\\) (the “+” in IEC+) further increased infection rates.\nEach of these “increases” happens in a proportional way (by a multiplicative factor); for example, since the Resting infection rate was higher for Memory cells, the increases in proportion infected were larger.\n\nThe math!\nWe can see how this happens by checking out the equation (leaving out the donor terms to keep it shorter).\n\\[logit(\\mu_i) = log(\\frac{\\mu_i}{(1-\\mu_i)}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 I_{Naive} + \\beta_2 I_{IEC-} + \\beta_3 I_{IEC+} + ... \\]\n(Here, each \\(I_{label}\\) is an indicator variable if that cell type is true, and 0 otherwise. And also, \\(\\frac{\\mu_i}{(1-\\mu_i)}\\) is the odds of infection!)\nExponentiating both sides, we get:\n\\[\\frac{\\mu_i}{(1-\\mu_i)} = e^{(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(I_{Naive}) + \\beta_2(I_{IEC-}) + \\beta_3(I_{IEC+}) + ...)}\\]\nSince \\(e^{(a + b)} = e^ae^b\\), that is\n\\[\\frac{\\mu_i}{(1-\\mu_i)} = e^{\\beta_0} e^{\\beta_1(I_{Naive})} e^{\\beta_2(I_{IEC-})} e^{\\beta_3(I_{IEC+})}...\\]\nAnd now, since \\(e^{ab} = (e^a)^b\\), we get\n\\[\\frac{\\mu_i}{(1-\\mu_i)} = e^{\\beta_0} (e^{\\beta_1})^{(I_{Naive})} (e^{\\beta_2})^{(I_{IEC-})} (e^{\\beta_3})^{(I_{IEC+})}\\dots\\] This means, for example, that when you change from Memory to Naive cells, the odds of infection with HIV are multiplied by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). (So the bigger the odds to begin with for Memory cells, the bigger the decrease when changing to Naive cells.) Cool!\n\n\nOfficial Interpretation\nHere’s how the Eddy et al. paper puts it:\n\n\nIn vivo, memory CD4+T cells are preferentially infected and harbor most of the latent reservoir. Therefore, we examined whether IEC stimulation has more effect on the memory population or the naïve population of resting CD4+T cells. We isolated CD4+CD45RO- naïve resting T cells and CD4+CD45RA- memory resting T cells from the same donor, and co-cultured them with IEC one day before infection. Infection rates (%GFP+) were examined on day 6 post-infection. We found that memory CD4+T cells were infected at much higher rates than naïve CD4+T cells in general (Fig. 1D, overall comparison between memory and naïve T cells, p&lt;0.0001). Although both memory and naïve CD4+T cells co-cultured with IEC still showed greater infectivity than those CD4+T cells cultured alone (Fig. 1D, p&lt;0.0001), the increases in infection for memory T cells were much higher than for naïve T cells: IEC − cocultures increased infection by &gt;10% on average in memory T cells compared with 1.5% in naïve T cells; likewise, IEC+cocultures increased infection by &gt;15% on average in memory T cells compared with 2% in naïve T cells. This suggested that signals provided by IEC to memory CD4+T cells were able to overcome the restrictions to a much greater extent than in naïve cells.\n\n\nYes, true, it’s pretty complicated. Why does it matter?\n\n\nThis is the first time IEC are implicated in HIV infection and pathology in the gut. As the intestinal mucosal area is a major site of HIV pathology and latency formation, this study highlights the importance of lymphoid tissue environment in HIV disease and persistence, particularly the involvement of EC in the gut microenvironment as a significant player.\n\n\nSo…this finding (along with a lot of other similar experiments) is helping to work out the details of how and where in the body HIV infection begins and persists. And to model the experimental results well, we needed our new friend the beta regression model.\nEnjoy having one more tool in your regression arsenal!",

    "text": "34.1 Section Learning Outcomes\nThere are some datasets that have a hierarchical structure to them, with data collected a several levels - for example, imagine a math tutoring program that tracks student progress over time in several different schools in each of several school districts. The levels are student, school, and district and there may be multiple datapoints - and relevant predictors - at each level.\nLooking at it from a really different angle, there are sometimes predictor variables that we really anticipate to impact response, but we’d hate to have to specify their values in order to make model predictions…in the example above, think of Student ID and school, for example.\nHere’s another way of thinking about it: sometimes, you have a categorical variable for which you’ve got plenty of observations of all the possible values of interest. For example, you want to understand whether people prefer to drink “coffee” or “tea” or “neither” – and have plenty of observations of people who prefer each. That’s a standard “fixed effect” predictor (what we’ve just been calling a “predictor” in our models so far). But other times, you have a categorical variable with a large to infinite range of possible values, and you’ve got observations of just a few: for instance, maybe the variable is City in a global dataset, or maybe it’s person_ID in a health claims data on thousands of Americans. In cases like these, you have data on only a small subset (or at least not all) of the possible “groups” of interest, and using such a variable as a standard “fixed effect” predictor in a regression model feels a bit off…because you don’t care to specify a single particular city or person to make predictions, but also because what about all the other cities and people you don’t have data on?\nAnd one more way of thinking about it (last one, I promise) – what if your data are collected at different levels of some kind of hierarchy? Going back to the school example, you might have students within a class (and know their age and demographic information), plus know which school their class is part of (and how big it is, what its geographic locations is, etc.), plus you know the school district the school belongs to (and whether it’s urban or rural, etc.) These are levels in a hierarchy of data. All the students in a district have the same district characteristics, but also their own individual-level characteristics like their age, too. The class of models we’re about to see can also help to organize and keep track of all these multiple levels.\nWhichever way we think about it…\nHierarchical models, aka random effects models, aka multilevel models, aka mixed effects models…to the rescue! (Note, aka stands for “also known as” - these models have many names but all refer to basically the same strategy.)\nBy the end of the module you will:",

    "text": "34.4 Dataset\nThis week’s dataset is about beaked whales, and how they might react to sounds made by naval vessels using mid-frequency sonar at sea (it’s used to hunt submarines, and is used in many training exercises and probably on real naval operations as well).\n\nThe Whales\nHere’s a tiny bit (1 minute!) about this type of whale:\n\n\n\n\nThe Tags\nAnd, although this next clip (also 1 minute) is about killer whales, it’s a tag that is similar to the one used to collect our data:\n\n\n\n\nThe Issue\nWhy would we expect that these animals might respond adversely to sonar sounds? Well…there have been some unusual mass stranding events. What? Well…\n\n\nSo what about sonar? The video below gives a bit of background, but also note that it’s produced by an environmental non-profit with a very specific point of view (they think the sonar is very harmful and have made this video to try to convince you of that). But, it also does give a quick bit of background. Just know that others (world navies, for one, and probably also most scientists) would present things a bit differently.\n\n\n\n\nAnd, back to our data\nThe data we’ll examine this time are from a paper by Erin Falcone and others published in 2017 (http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/4/8/170629.full.pdf).\nSatellite tags were used to record dive data and movements of 16 Cuvier’s beaked whales for up to 88 days each. The whales were incidentally exposed to different types of naval sonar exercises during the study period.\nNone of them were stranded, thankfully. But still they may have responded by changing their behavior, and examining how could help us understand how the sonar might affect them short- and long-terms, and maybe how similar reactions might in some cases lead to those strandings. So…\nHow did characteristics of the whales’ dives change during sonar exposure? We will look specifically at shallow dive duration as a response variable. We can read in the dataset like so:\nSome variables in the dataset include:\n\nDurAvg, the duration of each dive in hours\nDepthAvg, the maximum dive depth in meters\nStartTime of the dive (as a date time)\nTimeOfDay when the dive happened: “Dawn”, “Day”, “Dusk”, or “Night”\nWhether SonarA and SonarB (two different types of naval mid-frequency sonar) were present\nSonarAMinKm.fill and SonarBMinKm.fill, the minimum distance between known sonar sources and the whale (for each sonar type)\nSonarAPercOL.fill and SonarBPercOL.fill: the percent overlap between the sonar sounds and the whale’s dive (during what proportion of the dive were sonar sounds present?)\nTagDay, the calendar date of data collection\nPeriod, the two-hour period of the the TagDay when this dive happened\nTagDayPeriod combination of the TagDay and Period variables to give a unique ID for each 2-hour time block",

Well, in addition to whales being different from each other, maybe they are also different from themselves.\nHuh?\nI mean, maybe a whale’s behavior right now is more similar to its behavior 10 minutes ago than it is to behavior hours and hours ago. Whales maybe tend to behave one way for a while, then switch to a new mode.\nHow can we include this in our model? One way is to use the TagDayPeriod variable, which defines two-hour time blocks.

Their standard errors may vary, too, and although it’s not a rule, the SEs may often be biased small in the model without random effects, which means that if you used that no-RE model to draw conclusions, you might wrongly conclude there were real associations between some predictors and the response.\nBut more broadly: estimates and conclusions may definitely change when you add random effects. The good news: as we already know, if assessment conditions (like residual independence) aren’t met, the conclusions are not valid, but if we can ensure they’re met with the use of random effects, then we should be able to draw valid conclusions.",

    "section": "34.19 REML or ML?",
    "text": "34.19 REML or ML?\nThere are two different ways to fit these models to data:\n\nby maximizing the likelihood (ML, as we learned about earlier in the course). Unfortunately, it turns out that in this case, the ML estimates of the variance components (the random effects) is biased, toward underestimating variance, when sample size is small.\nby maximizing the restricted maximum likelihood (REML), which separates the likelhood into two parts (one with the fixed effects and one with the variance components). Maximizing parameters with respect to the second part only yields the REML estimators, which are unbiased and so preferred for smaller sample sizes. BUT there’s a catch…REML values can be used to compare models with different error and random effects structures, but not to determine which predictor variables should remain in a best model.\n\nSo, to do the type of model selection and inference we are used to, we want to always be sure to estimate our models via ML (not REML).\nHere, we do have a large sample size, so even if we use ML there should not be too much bias.\nIf we ensure our model is fitted by ML we can also try using AIC or BIC for model selection.\nThe default for glmmTMB() is to use ML. If you want to be explicit in requiring that (to make it transparent and remind yourself), you can add the input REML = FALSE.\nIf you ever use OTHER functions to fit random-effect models, know: The default of lmer() and glmer() is to use REML.

    "text": "34.20 Random Slopes?\nWhat we just practiced and called a “random effect” is sometimes also called a “random intercept” model because, although we allowed for an offset between the overall average predicted response value and that of an individual, we did not allow the slope of the relationship with any of the predictor variables to vary randomly with individual. It is possible to do this, although in my experience it often makes interpretation difficult.\nBefore you do it, think to yourself: do you really think that there is random variation in the relationship of the predictor with the response? One case where random slopes will work well is where there is a strong, clear overall effect and small variations in its magnitude between individuals. Another might be where the relationship with a certain predictor has very strong and very different slopes for different individuals, and you want to account for the added variability this adds to the model. Generally, fitting a random slope model requires a large dataset and interpretation can get VERY complicated; I recommend avoiding it unless you are VERY sure it’s a good idea.\nIn the glmmTMB() formula, a model with a random slope and intercept in relation to a particular quantitative predictor (PredictorVariable) and random effect or grouping variable (GroupingVariable) is specified with the form:\n\\[ ... + (PredictorVariable | GroupingVariable)\\] or equivalently \\[ ... + (1 + PredictorVariable | GroupingVariable)\\]\nIf you want to have a random slope for a certain predictor without the corresponding random intercept (I can’t think of an example where this would be a good idea but you can do it), then use:\n\\[ ... + (0 + PredictorVariable | GroupingVariable)\\]\nStill a bit confused about what random slopes are?

    "section": "34.21 Prediction Plots",
    "text": "34.21 Prediction Plots\nThere is a bit of added consideration involved in making prediction plots for some random effects models.\nUnlike GEEs, which provide marginal predictions (predictions of the population average value for any combination of predictor variable values), random effects models provide predictions for an average individual (that is, matching the average of all the random effect groups).\nFor a linear regression model (or any model with the identity link function, that is, no link function), the predicted values for the population average and average individual are the same.\nBut with a link function in the mix, it’s different. Consider a (hypothetical) example of a logistic regression vs linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the image above, the linear model case is the first plot, on the top. There, think of the central blue line as the “average RE group” (the prediction you’d get by setting the random effect variance to 0 in making predictions). If you think of each colored line as a different individual. Pick one predictor variable value – say, 5. To get the population average for x = 5, you’d add up the y-values for the light green, pink, blue, orange and green lines and divide by 5…and you would get the y-value along the blue line. Same happens for any other x-value you choose: the “average individual” is the same as the “population average.”\nIt’s not the same for the logistic regression example on the bottom. There, the “average individual” is the central grey line (and other random effect groups or “individuals” are the other grey lines). But if you follow the process described above to get the “population average” you’ll get, not the middle grey line, but the fat black line.\nSo, the average predicted response variable value across all possible random effect groups – that is, the marginal or population average – is not the same as the “average individual” or “average RE group” that is easy to compute from the model equation by setting the random effect value to 0.\n\nParametric bootstrap to the rescue!\nHow can we get around this problem? We can make predictions from our model for many, many (simulated) individuals to get a ``population” of predictions. Then, we can take a point-wise average over all those individuals (and also use them to find a CI), to get population average predictions and confidence intervals.\nWe can do this…and we’ll consider it all – prediction, interpretation, and drawing conclusions – in more detail next module!",
